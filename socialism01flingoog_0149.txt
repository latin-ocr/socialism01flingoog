146 SOCIALISM

supply and demand, cannot be disregarded. Eoonomio law oan-
not be set aeide by arbitrary will, nor oen it he made to operate
only in the interest ol one set oi persons. It is neither oapriaious
nor partial.

Iabour has an influente on velue. 'l'he labour expended in
the produotion of commodities must be remuneratsd or it will
not continue to be given, and the remuneration is a part ol the
eost oi productior which must bo returned in the velue of the
products. Nothing whioh does not repay the eost of produotion
will be permanently produoed. But oost oi production does not
alone determine the velue ol products3 and labour alone ia not
the only element of eost oi production. The orops reaped bytho
former, the articles fabricated bytho manufaoturer, must repay,

not merely their expenditur-e in weges but also in rent, machinam,
mutones and all other draina on ospital.

Marx ignores the influenoe of rent and capital on velue. He
reasons as il they had no existenoe; os ii Sooialism were already
established, and had suecessfully abolisbed thom. As they still
undoubtedly exist, however, and undoubtedly affeot eost and
prioe, end consequently velue, the theory which ‘⁴ abstreots ” ’
them, leaves them out oi aooount, and represents lahour alone as
the measure ol velue, is plainly one reaohed by shutting the eyes

to relevent but unweloome faeie. And rent and eapital are laets
whioh Soehhsm, even il established, could neither abolish nor
prevent influeuoing velue. The rent of land is just what is pald
ior its productius advantages3 and agriculturists would be an
intolerebly favoured alass in the eommunity‚ ii, under collectivam,
‚they did not eontinue to pay for thoee advantages. They would
pay, indeed, to the State instead oi to private landlords; but

they would equally have to pay, and the now arrangements
would as likelybe disadvantageous to them as the reverse. Were
the oapital invested in manuiaoturing industries oolleotivised that
oapital would aot, unless the oolleotivist State were bont on oom-
mitting suicide, be banded over apeoially to the workmen in these
industries; nor would the profits thereos be added to ttetrwages3
while the expenditure aud consumption of it necessary to
produotion would require to be returned out of the products,
however mueb weges might have to be diminished in
oonsequenoe.
