While the common error of Socialists is insisting

duty, the error of uprooting and annulling rights
through affirming a false conception of duty is
not unknown among them. Mr. Gronlund, for

of the State as an organism,'’ he says, “ consigna
‘the rights of man' to obscurity and puts duty in

the foreground.'' ⁴* And certainly it consigna the

may properly be treated with contempt, but in the
enlightened era which is approaohing it will be a
