government does its duty best when 11 preparas
the way for a reasonable and welloonditioned
Democraoy; and that although Democraoy, sar
from being necessarily good, may be the worst
of all govemments, it ean 11 so only through the
perversion of powers which ought 1ο make 11 111
best 01 all governments.

lt may be neoessary that one man should rule a
eommunity with almost unlimited and unoontrolled
power; 111 11 can only be so in evil times. The
rule 01 1 few may 01111 11 better than the rule of
many, for the few may 11 fit and the many unfit ;
but 1111 11 111111 1 vast missortune, and every
addition 10 111 number ol' the fit 11 assuredly great
gain. That the rule of one should give plaee 10 111
1ule of some, and the rule of some 10 111 rule of all,
if the rula be at 1111 as efficacious and righteous as
at first, is progress3 whereas 10 go from the rule
01111 towards that ο1 011 11011 11 to retrograde. A
government in whioh any alass of the people has no
share is almost certain 1ο 11 1 government unjust or
ungenerous 1011111111101 the people, and, therefore,
10 1111 extenta bad government. Ι1 may 11 certain
circumstancesbe foolishand wrongto extend politieal
power 10 all ; but 11 11 always a duty 1ο promote
whatever tende 10 make those from whom such
power is withhald entitled 10 possess it, by making
them able 10 111 11 wisely and rightly. In this
sense and 10 1111 extent every man, it seems 10
me, is bound 10 be the servant and soldier of
Democraoy. The hue gaal of life for eaoh of us
11 any sphere 01 existence is not our own selfish
