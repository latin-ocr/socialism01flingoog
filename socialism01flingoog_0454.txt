SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 453

Christian may, of course, criticise and disapprove of
them ; but it cannot he on Christian grounds ; it must
hemerelyon economic and political grounds, Whether
land is to be owned by few or many, by every one or
only by the State ; whether industry is to be entirely
under the direction of Government‚ or conducted by
co-opcrative associatione, or left to private enter·
prise; whether labour is to be remunerated by weges
or out of profits; whether wealth is to be equally or
unequally distributed, are not in themselves questions
of moment to the Christian life, or indeed questions
to which Christianity has any answer to give.
Socialism and Christianity, however, are by no
means entirely unrelated. Nor is their relationship
merely antagonism. Socialism is of its very nature,
indeed, erroneous and of evil tendency‚ seeing that
one-sidedness and exaggeration are precisely what
is distinctiva of it; and it does not contain any
truth or any good principle which is exclusively its
own. But it is not, therefore, to be thought of as
without any tmth or good in it; or as to be utterly
condemned and opposed. There is much in it which
is not distinctive of it or exclusively characteristic
of it. It isto a large extent an exaggeration or
misapplication of principles which are true and good,
which Christ has taught and sanctioned, which the
Coepel rests on and must stand or fall by; and
Christiane will betray Christ and the Gospel if they
desert these principles, or depreciate them, or allow
them to be evil spoken of, or act as if they were
ashamed of them, because Socialism has so far recog·

nised and adopt-ed them.
