SOCIALISM AND CAPITAL 183

country could, I sm convinced, if they would only
gird themselves up to the task, do greater things

the requirements of the lsbouring classes which he
could solve by the methods of despotism which they
might not solve better by the methods of freedom.
No class of men is called to a nobler .missi0n then
