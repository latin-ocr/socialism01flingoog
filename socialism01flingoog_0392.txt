huh we ought not to encourage meu to claim pre-

tended rights, and deaden in them¹ hhe sense of
gratitude for acts of kindness and generosity.

Individuals‚ voluntary associatione, and the Church
have often, in their dispensation of charihy, com·
mitted serious mistakes, and aggravated the evils
which they desired to remove. Buh they have not
erred more grievously than has the State. The old
English Poor Law was the cause of an enormous
amounhofpovertyandofdemoralisation. “ England,'’
says F awcett, “was brought nearer ho hhe brink of
ruin by it than she ever was by a hostile army.’' ⁴*

It would be a deplorable policy to enhrush hhe
State with the exclusive right to deal with the
problem of poverty, or with the means of satisfying
all the demands of poverhy. The result would
assuredly be that the State would waste and abusa
the resources foolishly confided to it, and that idle·
nese and vice would be encouraged. The State in
its dealings with poverhy should only be allowed to
act under clear and definite rules, and should be
kept rigidly to eoonomy. While it ought to see
that all charitable societies and institutions regularly
publish honest accounts, and should from time to
time carefully inquire inho and repert on the good
and avil results which they arc producing, it should,
instead of secking to substitute its own achion for
free and sponhaneous charity, encourage such oharity,
and only intervene in so far as may be necessary to
supply its deficiencies.
