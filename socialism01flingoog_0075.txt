72 SOCIALISM

any other man or orders of men.''ii There may heve
been some theoninis—it is difficolt to disprove a
negative-who omitted from his teeching of the
doctrine the condition expressed by Adam Smith in

⁴ ‘'Wealth oi Nations‚'' Bk. IV. ch. ix. p. 286 (Nicholson’s ed. ). Iu the
“introductory Essay” prefixed to his edition Proi. Nicholsou has made
some remarks on Adam smith which 1 cannot deny myseli the pleasurs oi
reproducing= “ The author ol the ‘Theory oi bloral Seutlments‚’ the key-
stone oi which is sympaihy‚ thoman who at his death leit amuch smaller
fortune thau was anticiparet, owing to hia constant expenditure iu deeds
oi unostentatious charity‚ the mau who was especially distinguished
amongst his contemporaries by his geniallty and kinduass, is popularly
supposed to be tho iether ol the dismsl dogmas which amongst the vulgar
(il the term may be still used ln its older signification) pass current ior
Political liconomy, The most cursory porussi ol the ‘ Weulth oi Nations:

however, will convince the reader that the spirit in which lt is written is .

esseutially human, aud the most carelul scrutiny will bring to light no
passage iu which the doctrine ol ⁴ selfishness' is inculcated. 'l'he 'economio
man‚' the supposed incarnation oi selflahness, is uo creation ol Adam Smith;

all the characters oi the ‘Wealth oi Nations' ars real-Englishmen ’

Dutohmen, Ohinesa The ‘economic mau' ol ultra-Ricardiaus is no more
to be found in Adam Smith than is the ‘socialistic mao,¹ the incarnation
oi unseldshness, the man who loves all meu more than himself on the
arithmetical ground that all meu are 'more thau oue. Adam Smith was
unacquuinted with auy society composed mainly oi either species. Oi
the ‘socialistlc man' he writes: ‘ 1 hare never known much good done by
those who affected to trade ior the publio good It is an allactation
indeed not very common among mercham, aud very few words need be
employed in dissuading them from it· But the most severe passages ln
Smith's work are those iu which he condemns the various ‘mean and
malignant expedienta' ol the mercantlle system, aud satirisea the ‘eco-
nomic' merehauts who, actuated only by the ‘passionate confidence oi
luterested ialsehood,' iu order to promote ‘the little interest ol one little
order oi meu in one country hurt the interest oi all other orders oi men
in that country, and oi all other men in all other countrles.' Adam Smith
treats ol actual societies, aud considers the normal conduct oi average
individuale· .(pp. 13.1¹4). The present writer, in the article ‘¹ Buckle,’'
,published about twenty years ugo ln the “Enoyclopaedla Britannica,”
indicated how little foundation there was ior the opinion that in the
‘⁴ Theory oi M orel sentimenta '³ man was represented aa purely benevoleut
aud in the “Wealth ol Natlous'' as purely seldsh. comparatively re·'
oeutly Dr. Richard Zeyss‚ iu bis “Adam Smith und der liigennutz‚” 1889,
- has dealt with the same question more iully aud quite conclusively.
