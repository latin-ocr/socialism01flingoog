62 SOCIALISM

‘organisation oi labour by society,' instead ol the distracting
competition of private capitalists5 that is to say, corporate
organisation and management oi the process of productiori
in the place of private businesses; public organisation ol the
labour oi all ou the basis oi collective ownership oi all the
working materiale ol social labour; and finally, distribution
ol the collective outpnt of all kinds of manufacture in pre
portion to the velue and amount ol the work done by each
worker. The producere would still be, individually, no more
than workmen, aethere would no longer be any private property
in the instrumenta oi productiori, and all would, in ieet, be work-
ing with the instrumente of productiori belonging to all—ie,
collective capital. But they would not be working as private
manufactnrers and their workmen, but would all be on an equal
footing as professionel. workers, directly organised, and paid their
salary, by society as a whole. Consequently, there would no
longer exist in future the present fundamental division of private
income into propiis (or in some cases the creditor’s share, by way

 

oi interest, in the profit oi the debtor) and wayea, but all incomes ¹

would equally represent a share in the national produce, allotted
directly by the commuuity in proportion to the work, done-that
is, exclusive returns to labour. Those who yielded services of
general utility as judges, administrative officials, tenebere, artists,

scientific investigators, instead ol producing material commodities
—i.e., all not immediately productius workers, all not employed
in the social circulation oi material, would receive a share in the
commodities produced by the rational labour, proportioned to the
time spent by them in work useiul to the community.’' *

The Socialism thus described hae come to be
commonly designated Collectivism and the name is

convenient and appropriate. It is the only kind of Ι ζ

Socialism greatly in reputa at present, or really
formidable; and, consequently, it is the form of it
which especially requires to be examined. It is the
