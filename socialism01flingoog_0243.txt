240 SOCIALISM

Of course, Collectivists protest against the impu·
tation of wishing to introduce slavery. And I do
not imputo to them the wish People osten do the
opposite of what they wish. My charge is that if
they establish Oollectivism they will introduce
slavery, whether they wish to do it or not. How,
then, do they repel this charge that Collectivism is
slavery, or necessarily irnplies it? It is by declar·
ing that they desire only to appropriate the means
and regulate the operatione of productim, but that
they will leave every one free as regards consump
tion. Labour and capital must be collectivs; but
each individual may spend as he pleases what he
receives as his share of the collective product, pro·
vided always that he does not employ it produc-
tively.

And this is supposed to be an answer, and one so
satisfactory that no other need be given. If so,
however, there never has been such a being as a
slave in the world. Slavery is not forced enjoyment
or consumption, but forced labour and productiori.
Collectivism, therefore, only offers us what avowed

slavery itself cannot withhold.

The reply plainly does not meet the objection so
far as productiori is concerned. It leaves it intact
to the extent that men as labourers, as producere,
are to be without any freedom of choica or contract;
that every man is to be absolutely dependent on the

State so far as earning a livelihood is concerned;
that the officere of the State are to assign to all its
subjecte what they are to do to gain their breed and
to determine what amount of breed they are to get
