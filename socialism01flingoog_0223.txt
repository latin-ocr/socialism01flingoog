220 SOCIALISM

For having thus argued at such length that jus·
tice does not demand the nationalisation of the land
of the country, my excuse must be that so many
persons are at present loudly asserting the contrary,
and endeavouring to make it appear that private
property in land is morally wrong, and that to ex-
propriate landowners without compensation would
be en innocent or a virtuous act.

Ido not maintain that to nationalise the land
would be in itself unjust. If private property in
land may be just,¹ so may national or collective pro
party be. WhatI fail to see is, how national or
collective property in land can be just, if private
or individua] property therein must necessarily be
unjust. Nationalisation of the land would be quite
just if the present proprietors were bought out, and
if men were lelt not less free than they are at
present to purchase the use of the land in fair com·
petition. It is quite possible to conceive of a kind
of nationalisation of the land which would not inter·
fere with the liberty of individuale in regard to the
possession or tenure of land, and which would con-
sequently not be Socialism at all in the sense in
which I employ the term. Could it be shown that

to nationalise the land by the national purchase and
administration of it would be clearly for the good of
the nation, Ι should have no hesitation in advocat·
ing its nationalisation.
