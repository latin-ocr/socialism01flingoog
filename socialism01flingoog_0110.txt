SOCIALISM AND LABOUR ¹07

nomists of high standing, that labour is the sole
source of wealth; that an object has value only in
sofar as it is the result of human toil; that every
economic productis merely, as has been said, “ a de·
finite mass of congealed labour-time.'' It insiste that
the valueof an object ought to be estimated entirely
according to the quantity of labour it has cost, the
quantity being measured by the average time which
it takes to perform it. All commodities, it main·
taius, are so many “ crystallisations of human
activity ”; and all of them which require the same
extentos time to produce them are of the same
value. Any labour is equivalent to all other labour,
because it equally represents the mean or average
of social labour. From this view of the function of
labour in the economic process Socialists draw the
inference that as labourers alone produce all wealth
they alone should enjoy it; that the just wage of a
workman is all that he produces or its full value;
that whatever a landlord or capitalist deducta from
this is robbery; and that such robbery is the great
cause of poverty and its attendant evils.

This teaching seems to me a mass of congealed
fallacias. Labour alone can produce nothing, can
create no particle of wealth, can satisfy no economic
want. All labour which is alone is pure waste.
Labour, imtead of being the source of all velue, is
itself only of value in so far as it results in remov-

labour is never alone, but always inseparably oon·
