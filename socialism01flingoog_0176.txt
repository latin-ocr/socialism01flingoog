SOCIALISM AND CAPITAL 173

sumption of wealth in order to profit by it as
capital, runs the risk of losing it, whether he employ
it himself or lend it to another. In either case it is
absurd to expect him to run the risk without chance
of advantage. In the former he must even add the
labour of administraticn to the cares of the capitalistâ€š
and such lahour is not less entitled to recompensa
than that of the operative. In the latter, although
he may so lend that the danger of loss is trifling,
it is never wholly eliminated, and where security
is good the remuneration for mere investment is
small.

Moreover, the return for capital, the share of
produce which its owner obtains for the loen of it,
varies naturally according to conditione of demand
and supply, and very largely owing to the demand
of those who seek the wealth of others for the sake
of the profit which they believe they can derive
from it as capital. But manifestly there is no
injustioe in men paying for the use of what is not
their own a share of the profit or produce which the
usa of it brings them. On the contrary, it is only
right that they should do so in proportion both to
the amount of the capital and the length of time
during which its use is obtained.

The rightful ownership of the wealth from which
capital is formed, the abstinence from consumption
involved in its formation, the risk run in its employ-
ment cr investment, and the benefit- conferred on
enterprise and labour by the use of it, are the
grounds on which the claim of capital to remunera-
tion rest, and on which it is to be defended. Olearer
