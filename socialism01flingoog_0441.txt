440 SOCIALISM

equalisation of conditione, which are the distinctiva
characteristica of Socialism3 an express condemna-
tion of Socialism in itself as uncatholic and un-
christian. ln his Encyclical the Pope recognises no
' such distinction as that oi a true and a salse
Soeialism, but treats as false all that is truly
Socialism.*

The Protestant view regarding the labour and
soeial question is almost identical with that so
skilfully presented by the Pope as Catholic, and
can only cease to be so by ceasing to be Christian.
Catholics and Protestants hold as Christians a
common deposit of truth absolutely essential to
the welfare of society and of the labouring classes ;
and they can neither consistently nor wisely sur-
render a coin of it for one which has come from the
mint of Socialism.

Christianity and Socialism, then, are not so
related as those who are styled Christian Socialists

* Obiections may, Ithink, be legitimately taken to the affirmation in
the Encyclical oi the right oi the labourer to a minimum wege. Its chiei
deiect, perhaps, is want oi explicitness. Doee it mean that the employer
oi labour ie bound tc pey to those whom he employs weges which although
not more than necessary to their reasonable end frugal comfort, are yet
more then he can pay without producing at a loesi 1 donet suppose that
the Pope intended to affirm this; but he has been so understood, and in
consequence claimed or blamed as a Socialist. lior the allegation thet he
hae sanctioned the theory that weges ought tc be determined by nantel
cen perceive uo mounde.

It may here be added thet the social question aa related to Christianity
on the one hund and to Sociuiiem on the other, hae been judiciously and
ably treated by some oi the Catholic clergy‚ and especially by some oi the
Jeeuit fathers—ay.. V. Cathrein, A. Lehmkuhl, 'rh Meyer, hc. See Die
Sociale Frage, beleuchtet durch “die stimmen aus Maria-inach.” The
widely-known work oi Dr. Rutzinger, “Die Volkswirthschait in ihren
sittlichen Grundlagen,'’ 1881, is eloquent and interesting, but not infre-
quently unguerded and extreme.
