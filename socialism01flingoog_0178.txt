they found them in the Scripturas, to the whole
teaching of which they deemed themselves bound to
yield implicit obedimus* But Socialists have in
general no such plea to urge.

Nor have they any new arguments to supply the
place formerly filled by authority. The ancient soph-
ism that money is sterile, and that as the essenos of
every equitable loan is precisely to return what was
lent or its equivalent‚ to exact interest is a sort of
robbery, is still the only thing like an argument
which the most recent Socialists can adduce. As
regards this argument ΜΓ. Lecky hardly speaks too
strongly when he says, “it is enough to make one
ashamed of one's species to think that Bentham was
the first tc bring into notice the simple considera·
tion, that if the borrower employa the borrowed
money in buying bulls and cows, and if these
produce calves to ten times the value of the interest,
the money borrowed can scarcely be said to be
sterile or the borrower a loser.'’ But what are we
to think of those who are unable to see the force of
such a consideration even when it has been pointed
ont to them? What are we tc think of the intelli·
gence of those whose only answer to itis, “We are
not reasoning about bulls and cows but about pieoes
of gold and silver, which do not beget smaller pisces,
and so multiplyl'’ The argument plainly implios

⁹ Further, in antiqnlty and the Middle Ages interest was generally
exorbitant, and loans were generally made with a view not to productiori
and the acquisitum of gain but to consumptlon and the satisfactlon of
mut.
