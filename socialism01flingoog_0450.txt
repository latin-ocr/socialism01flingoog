SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 449

society a dissolving and corrupting power, ol which
Socialism is the natural outcome* This is surely an
insufficient explanation. Protestantism was not an
assault on authority, but essentially an appeal to
authority, true and divine authority, that authority
a recognition cf which is the only and the adequate
defence against both the despotin and the revolu-
tionary tendencies of Socialism. Besides, Socialism
springs aven more from the abuse of authority than
from illegitimate resistance to it. Catholicism
tends more to Socialism and less to Individualism
than Protestantism. Socialism preceded as well as
accompanied the Reformation. In countries where
Protestantism took firm root, Socialism has been
late in appearing, and now that it has appeared in
them it is very far from confined to them. Italy,
Spain, France, Belgium, and Austria are not Protes-
tant countries, and yet a very virulent sort ol
Socialism is at work in them.

The Reformation, I admit, was not an unmixed
good. Protestantism has shown, and is everywhere
showing, tendencies to disruption and dissolution
which bode ill for the success ol its endeavours
to leaven society with the Gospel, even in the
countries where it is most dominant. So long as it
is content to remain broken up as at present into
competing and conflicting denominatione, it cannot
possibly discharge effectively the duties to society,
and especially to the poorer classes of society,

rapport avec le Sociah'sme.” Bruxellss. 1852.
