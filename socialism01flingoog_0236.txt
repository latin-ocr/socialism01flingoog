THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 233

dwell onsuch lacteas the growth 01 governmental
intervention, the extension of the public service and
public departments, the absorption of small by large
industries, the increase of cooperative enterprise,
and the multiplicatiori of limited liability companieS,
ss evidences and phases 010 development of indivi-
dual capitula into collective capital. These facts are
plainly, however, nothing of the kind. The associa-
tion of capitale in* large industries, in cooperative
societies, in joint-stock companies, is in no case the
slightest step towards rendering them not private
but public, not individua] but common. Associated
capitale are not more easily bought up than separate
capitals. While, therefore, history does undoubtedly
show 0 process of social evolution which obviously
tends totbeenlargemeut ofindustrial andcommercial
enterprise through extensior of the association of
resources and energies, such evolution is essentially
different from an evolution towards the realisation
of Oollectivism. Of the latter kind of evolution
there are happily no traces yet visible; nor is there
the least probability that capitalists will ever be so
foolish 00 to cast themselves into any stream of
evolution which will transfer their property to the
community without compensation.l
