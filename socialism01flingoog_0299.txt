such workmen never can be very badly paid in a
free country. That she will ever perfeotly solve the
problem indicated Ι am not eo optimistic as to sup·

politioe; Ihave much more confidence in what, to
use mathematica] phraseology, may be called crymp-
totic solutions-continual approximatione to ideale
never completely reached.

There ie, secondly, a class of workmen whose
destitution is mainly sels-caused3 mainly due to
intemperanoo, to idlenese, and to other forms os vioe.
It is impossible to follow in regard to thern the
advice of ΜΓ. Herbert Spencer-“ Do nothing; leave
‘ good-for-nothings' to perish.’' The humen beart
is not hard enough for that; and human society is
not wholly guiltless of the faults even of the least
worthy of ita members. On the other hand, simply
to give charity to the idle, the drunken, and dis·
solute, is to increase the evil we deplora, and to
divert charity from ite proper objecta. ,Wharis
wanted is a system which will couple provision for
the relies of the unworthy with conditione of labour
and amendment, so that their appeals for charity
can be refused with the knowledge that they have
only to work and be sober in order not to starve.
To devise an appropriate system of the kind ie
doubtless difficult, but surely is not impossible.
