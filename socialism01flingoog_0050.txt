HISTORY OF SOCIALISM 47

Yet there is nothing to warrant a pessimistic view
of the course of coming events, or despair as to the
future. The resources for good which providence
has placed in the hands of the British people are
immense, and, if faithfully used, they are amply
adequate to avert every danger. Although the
extremes of poverty and wealth in this country ΒΘ
at an enormous distance from each other, the whole
, interval is filled up by classes which pass into one
another by insensible gradatione, and which collect·
ively so outnumber either the very rich or the very
poor that at present the chance of success of any
socialistic revolution· must ΒΘ pronounced infini-
tesimally small. The workmen of Great Britain
have never, like the citizens of Greece and Rome,
sought to get free ol' work, but onlyto ΒΘ better paid
for their work. A feeling of the honourableness
of labour is on the increase. Socialism itself isa
testimony to the growth of the sense of brother·
hood. Faith in God and faith in duty may have
been here and there shaken, but they have not
been uprooted, and are even widely and vigorously
displaying their vitality. individuality of character
and the love of personal independence will not ΒΘ
easily vanquished in Britain. It has never been the
character of the nation to adopt vague and revolu-
tionary proposals without criticism of them and con·
sideration of their eost. We may ΒΘ less exposed to
the dangers of individualism, and more to those of
Socialism, than we were twenty years ago, butte

be afraid of the speedy and decisivo triumph of
Socialism is to be foolishly elarmed.
