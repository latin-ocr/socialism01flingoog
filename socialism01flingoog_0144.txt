SOCIALISM AND LABOUR 14¹

valnes they are merely different quuntities, and oonsequently do not

“If, then, we leave ont oi consideration the nse-vulne oi eommodities
they have only one common property leit, that oi being products oi
labonr. But even the produnt oi lahem itseli has undergone a ohange
in our hande. Ii we make abstraction from its nse-vulne, we make
abstraction attho same time from the material elements and shepes that
make the produnt a nse-valne; we see in it no longera table, a houm,
yarn, or any other usetnl thing. Its existence as a material thing ts put
out oi sight. Neither ean it any longer be regarded as the produnt of the
lahonr oi the joiner, the meson, the spinner, or oi any other definite kind ot
prodnotive labour. Along with the nseinl qualitiea oi the products them-
selves, we put ont of eight both the assini eharaoter oi the various kinds
ot labour embodied in them, end the eonorete forms of that labonr ς there
isnothing leit but what is eommon to them 2113 all are reduoed to one

“ het aa now consider the residue oleseh ol these prodnots ; lt ooneists
of the same nnsuhstantisl reality ln each, a mere congelatione! homo-
geneons human labens, ot lsbonr-power expended without regnrd to the
mode oi its expenditnre. All that these things now tenuate, that human
labem-power is emhodled in them. When looked st as orystals oi this
soeiul substance, eommon tn them all, they are-valnee.

“ We haee seen that when eommodlties are exchanged, their exohange
velue manifeste itself as something totally independent oi their nse-vulne.
But if we obstruet from the1r nse-vulne there remeius their valae aa

Snoh is the argument. Obviously it begins with the assump-
tion of a developed system of exohange, an organised trade with
common weights and mensures, ewtn, quartem, de, and a bost oi
exnet and invariable equations ol velue reeognised as existing
between exehnngeable objecto. The assumption is unfair, and we
een never hope to understand the nature oi exchange ii we
examine it only at sueh a point. What we must eommenoe by
loolring at is exehenge in its roots and rudimenta, the rudest and
most elementary exohanges‚ those of the kind out oi whieh all
others must have grown. The simplest eoneeivable erchangee
