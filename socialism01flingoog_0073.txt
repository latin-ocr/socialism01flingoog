70 SOCIALISM

real and precious advantages of good government,
to bear his share of its necessary expensos3 that, on
the contrary, to refuso to do so would be selfish,
unreesouable, and unjust. The State, in my vieW,
has a variety of functious through the right exer-
cise of which all its members are greatly benefited,
and for the exercise of which, therefore, they
may be fairly required collectively to provide.
The political Individualism which denies to the
State tho right to intervene in any measure or
in any circumstances for the positive development
of industry, intelligence, scienoe, morality, art, is
as erroneous, and, could it be consistently and
completely carried out, which happily it cannot,
would be almost as pernicious as fully developed
Socialism. ·

Does it follow that one who thus discards indi-
vidualistic theories of the limits of the State must
needs accept some socialistic theory thereof, or can
at least have no firm standing ground from which
to opposs Socielism, or definite and sound criteria
hy which to test itl By uo means. It is true that
he has not a theory which he can sum up in a
sentence like either the Socialist or the Indi·
vidualist. It is not so easy to formulate a theory
which will apply to all the relevant facts with all
their complications and variationem to formulate
one which is a mere ideal of the reason or imagina-
tion, and calmly or boldly indifferent to all trouble·
some and antagonistic realities. But though neither
an Individualist nor a Socialist, a man need not be
-end if he undertake to discuss political subjects
