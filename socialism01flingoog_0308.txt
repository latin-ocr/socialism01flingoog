good, or the good 01 any class moeste, but the
good 01011; and so the goel at which each 01 us
ought to aim in politioal life is the good government
01 011, by the association and oo-operation 01 011, in
the spirit expressed and demanded by these words
of Jesus: “Let him who would be the first among
you make himself the servant 01 011.”

11 is 0 duty, then, to work towards, and 011 behalf
of, Democraoy3 but only towards, and on behalf 01,
0 Democraoy which knows its own limitatione, which
perceives that its distinctiva truth is not the whole
truth, and that, therefore, to be exclusive and
thoroughly sels-consistent and complete, instead of
being an obligatior under which it lies, is a danger
against which it must always be anxiously on its
guard.

The truth distinctiva of Democraoy, Ihave said,
is not the whole truth 01 government. The truth
in Monarchy, the necessity of unity 01 rule and
administration‚ of a single, centralising, presiding
Will, isalsoagreatandimportanttruth. In all times
01 violence and 01 discord it has come 10 be felt as
the supreme want 01 society. Wherever Democracy
rushes into extremes there sets in a reaction

, towards unity in exaesa the unity 01 despotism.

The truth in the idea 01 Aristocracy: the truth
that· there must always be in society those who
lead and those who foll0w; and that it is 01 almost
incalculable moment for 0 people that those who lead
it be those who are ablest 10 lead it; its men 01
greatest power, energy, and insight, its wisest and
best men: is likewise 0 truth which will never cease
