SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 445

verdeis, or fail to assign due importunae ιο it as a
socia] soree, it must necessarily be a defective and
false theory of society.

The i'crms both of Socialism and of Religion,
however, are many, and so we cannot affirm in a
genera] way much more than that what is true in
ihe one cannot be brought into agreement with what
is false in ihe other.

world would create a difficulty. It is difficuit ιο iit God and His worship
into such a scheme. Religion presente a intare iiie more noble and lasting
than the present. having its cvvn rewards and punishments awarded ιο
conduct in this iiie, and not dependent merely cn the service oi humanity
but cn the service ci ch. Any aet is good cr bad according as it pleases
ch. and not simply as it tenda to the general good ci men collectively.
Again, religion aima primarily at individnal sanctification ior happiness iu
the next iiie, and only secondarily ior the material prosperity ci all in this.
Now, religion and the worship cf ch is a standing fact, and the Socialist

war against all class distinctions, and especially against the governing
class. In the sccialistic state the gcvernment musi be by the pecpie ior

ircm the pecpie, be exercised in their name, and be terminabis at their
will. Iu such a state what place is there ior eeclesiastical authority?
Religion supposes an authority derived from ch tc regulata a system ior
the worship ci ch. The catholic Ohurch has a hierarchy oi officials-
pcpe, bishcps, and ciergy-with authority tc command ibe obedience ci
thepecpie independenter the State. These officials cannot rule at the
will ci ihs State, uor can their authority be derived irem it. Hence
sacerdotalism becomes one oi tire bngbears cl socialism. Unable ιο
arrange their ideal State ιο include au independent ecclesiastieal authority,
Socialists are led ιο abciish religion in order ιο get rid ci iis ministare.

Thus the process oi general leveiling and the sbciiiicn ci independent
authority leads ιο the negaticn oi religion and formai worship ci (iod, and
makes Socialism tend ιο ειοοίειιι.”-Τ1ιο ostiolis fimes, August ιο, 1894. 2
