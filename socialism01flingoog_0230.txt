NATIONALISATION OF THE LAND 227

mere fmmers it would soon be, if not ruined,
seriously deteriorated. Hence probably, in the case
of the land being nationalised, it would be found
expedient to allow the occupiers of land under the
State fixity of tenure and judicial rents, or, in other
wo1ds,a virtual proprietary right and a monopolistio
privilege. But this state of things would certainly
beneither more just nor more profitableto the general
community, and especially to the labouring classes,
than the system which at present prevails.

It is unneoessary to discuss either the proposal
that the State should restore agricultural village
communities or that it should create agricultural
co-operative associatione. In exceptional circum-
stances both the agricultural village community and
the agricultural oo-operative society might, perhaps,
be established with good results under the fostering
care and guidance of a sagacious, generous‚ and
wealthy individual; but the former has so many
economic defecta, and the success of the latter
implies so many favourahle contingencies not likely
to be found in conjunction, that no prudent Govern·
ment will feel itself warranted to spend any con-
siderable sum of public money in calling them into
existence. No person in this country, sofar as I
am aware, has been so unwise as to contend that the
land should be nationalised with a view to a general
adoption of either of these forms of rural economy.*
