a doctrine with a view to justify end inflame it. He taught
messes of men just what they were anxious to believe; and hence
they believed him.

Thst portion of the treetise of Marx which deals with the
effecte oi capitelist productionis, on the other hand, oi very oon·
sidersble velue. It is elso the fullest expression oi what was
beet in hie nature, his sympathy with the poor; a sympathy
which, although by uo means pure, was undoubtedly sincere end
intense. The large manufacturing system during the first fifty
yeers oi its history in thie country was enormously productive,
not only oi wealth, but of misery, of vice, of human degradation.
The glitter oi the riches which it created so dazded the eyes ol
the vest majority oi men that they were blind to the disorgeni-
sation, the oppression, the abominatione, which it covered. The
most honest and intelligent persons took fer too rosy a view of
it, or, at the most, timidly apologised for practices which they
should have felt to be intolersble. But the reection et length
came. 'l'he strugglee of the victims of the system mede them-

era oi regulated development, of incipient but growing organisa-

these soci the light which parliamentsry inquiries hed elicited es
to the evils oi a capitalism allowed to tremple on physiologioal
and moral laws3 and causing it thence to rediate over the world.
It is true, indeed, thet Marx, in that portion of hie work to
which I refer, eontinnslly confounds merely incidental with
necessary consequenoes. Still the evils which he so vigorously

describes and assails were mostly real consequenoee; and his
exposure oi them must have helped to destroy them, end to
render their return impossible.

On the inierenoee which he hns drawn irom his doctrine, and
