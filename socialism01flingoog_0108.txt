' Unfortunately many Socialists refuse to acquiesce
in this view of the situation. They have corneto
the conclusion that the condition of the labouring
classes is so bed that the first and chief duty of
those who hefriend them is to spread among them,
as widely and deeply as possible, discontent with
their lot. And, accordingly, they concontrate their
efforts on the attainment of this end. By the
selection only of what suits their purpose, by the
omission of all facts, however certain and relevant,
which would contravene it, and by lavishness in ex-
aggeration, the past and present of the labouring
classes are so delineated as to embitter their feelings
and pervert their judgments, while their future is
portraysd in the colours of fancy best adapted to
deepen the effect produced by the falsification of
history and the misrepresentetion of actuality.
Further, assertione the most untrue, yet which
are sure to be readily believed by many, end which
cannot fail to produce discontent as widely as they
are believed, are boldly and incessantly made in all
ways and forms likely to gain for them acceptance.

plundered by privileged idlers to the extent of a
half or threelourths of what is due for their ser·
vioes3 that capitalists are their enemies; that
mechanical inventions have been of little, if any,
