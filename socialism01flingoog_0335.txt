of this kind, and hence its influence on Democracy
must necessarily be evil.

Fureher, Socialism must act unfavourably on
Democraoy in sofar aa it infuses into it its own
excessivo saith in the rights and powers of the
Staio· The distinotive tendency of Socialism is
unduly to extend the sphera and functione of the
State, and to make individuale completely depen-
dent on corporate society. For the Sooialist the
will of the State should be revered as authoritative
in itself and accepted without question as the
supreme and comprehensive law of human conduct.
This reverence and obedience it does not receive, and
is not entitled to receive, at present, because itis
confounded with government‚ as contradictinguished
from society3 but when this opposition is done away
with, and the State will become the expression or
personifioation of organised society, of the socialised
commonwealth, there can be no higher source of
authority in the universe, no worthier object of
worship; and then no one must be allowed to show
it disrespect or to challenge its behests. “ Socielists,”
says one of the most scientific and learned among
them, ‘⁴ have to incrdcate that spirit which would
give offenders against the State short shrift and the
nearest lamp-post. Every citizen must learn to say

with Louis XIV, L’Ear c'cst moi.”†
