SOCIALISM AN Ι) RELIGION 433

indispensable to the higher life of man and to the
progress and prosperity of communities; that a posi-
tive saith which may not inappropriately be termed
religious isan essentia] condition of healthy develop-
ment. They testify also to an eageruess in their
authors to believe that a golden age, a time os bliss,
is near—one in which all antagonisms will be recon-
ciled‚ and all the wants of the human spirit satisfied‚
which is itself of pathetio interest, springing as it
does from sheer hunger of soul. There is nothing
in their principles or in their arguments to justify
their optimism. Their wish is sole father to their
thought. Faith is seen still struggling torisa in
them, although they have cast away all its supports.

Criticism of the attempts referred to is not neces-
sary. While professing to preserve Religion, they in
reality suppressit. They would “abolish current ’
antagonisms’' by sacrificiug the spirit to the flesh
and the “other world ’' to this world; by deuying
God and deifying humanity. The identification of
Socialism and Religion at which they ¹arrive‚ assumes ·
the identity of Religion and Atheism. They neither
solve antinomies of thought nor reconcilo antago-
nisms os life3 they neither remove intellectual
difficulties nor serve practioal ends, Those who
have regarded them as great philosophical achieve·
ments have been deceived by equivocal terma and
boastful protensione.

3. Another view as to tha relation of Socialism to
Religion is that it is essentially one of harmony—
Religion and Socialism implyiug, supporting, and
supplementing each other.
