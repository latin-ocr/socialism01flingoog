Observe, that, according to the hypothesis oi Marx himself, the
workmen are not only free, but as yet undegraded and unmennod
by the operation oi the system of ospitalism. Yet he asks us to
believe that they submit ιο give the ospitalist twice the amount
oi labour which they are paid for, twelve lrours instead oi six.
The capitelist, according to Marx, cannot give them less than the
velue of their six hours oi labour. Why, then, should they give
him six hours gratisl Ii he isto make profit at all he cannot
reiuse ιο accept from thom one hour or even half an bour mone,
and yet pay them as muoh ior the aix and a hali or seven bours
as Marx represents him as paying ior the twelve hours. In a
word, Marx attributes to the ‹apitaliet a power and to the work·
meu a ioolishness incredible on any hypothesis, but especially
inoredible on his own, seoing that ii the capitalist be wholly
dependent on human labour ior his profit he must be weah, and il
the labour-power of the worhmeu be the sols source oi value they
must be blind indeed ii they do not recognise their own strength,
and see that the eapitalist must take any amount of time,
however little beyond six hours whioh they ars pleesed to grant
The only semblanoe of reason which Marx gives for osoribing
to the capitalist suoh power as he does is that “he who onoe
realises the exchangevalue of labour-power, or of any other
commodity, parts with its use-value”; that “the usevalue oi
labourpower onoe bought belongs just as much to its buyer as
the usevulne oi oil efter it his been sold belongs to the deuler
who has bought it ”; that “when labour actually begins it has
alreudy remed to belong to the labourer, and consequently cannot
again be sold by him.'’v This pretence oi prool Profa wolf oi

the use oi it for a limited time, he loses his rights over it for an
unlimited time. A workman selle the use oi bis labour-power on
