hut he adduces no evidence for the statement, and
does not assign a date to the alleged origination.
Mr. Kirkup, in his “ History of Sociulism‚” tells us
that it was “coined in England in 1835.’'† In
proof he merely refers to the following statement in
Mr. Holyoake’s ‘⁶ History of (lo-operation '' (vol. i.
p. 210, ed. 1875): “The term Socialism was first
introduced on the formation of the Society of All
Classes of All Nationa the members of which came
to be known as socialists.'’ But the statement is
seltteontradictory. If the members of the Society
referred to only “ come to be known aa socialists ''
the term Socialism was certainly aot “first introduced
on tltcforuaatioo os tlte Society,'' but oster tlte Society
tad been somned. How long after? That Mr. ·

Holyoake has not told us3 nor has he supported
his statement by any confirmatory quotations or
references. The term Socialism may, perhaps, have
originated in England3 may even, perhaps, have
been coined there in 1835 ; but, sofar as Iam aware,
no evidence has been adduced that such was the
case, nor any information afforded as to how the
term was employed by those who are said to have
first used it in Englaud. The matter will no doubt
be cleared up in due time either by some private
inquiror or in the great English Dictionary edited

by Dr. Murray.
