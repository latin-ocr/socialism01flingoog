THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 237

affectione, the particular interests, and the personal
motivas of individuals

As has been often indicated, no council of the
'wisost men in london, although invested with abso-
lute powers, could feed, clothe, lodgs, and employ
the population of that city, were no man allowed to
act without having their authority; were no com-
petition permitted in buying and selling; and were
wages and prices prohibited, and some supposed
strictly rational determination of what labour was to
receive and what commodities were to be exchanged
for, adopted instead. The problem involved is of a
kind which cannot be solved by the reasoning and
calculation, the legislation and administration, even
of the wisest and most uncontrolled rulers: it can
only be solved, as it actually is solved, by leaving men
free, each to seek his own interest and to attend to
his own business3 to carry his services or his goods
where the rise of weges or of prices shows that they
are most wanted; and to withhold them where the
fall of wages or of prices warns him that the market
isoverstocked. Even when this method of freedom
and of nature is followed numerous mistekes will
occur, but they will be comparatively slight, and
those of one man will oonnteract those of another,
while every man’s intelligencc and energies will be
so stimulated by his interest that the general end
to be attained‚ gigantic as it is, will be reached,
although feo, if any, directly and exclusively strive
for it, and many seek merely their own private
benefit. But let the collectivist method be tried,
and the risk of mistakes willbe immensely increased3
