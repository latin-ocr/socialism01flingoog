no love of a tortured man-god, hut solely for the

fellow·men-I act morally, that is, socially .....
Socialism arises from the recognition (1) that the
sole aim of mankind is happiness in this life, and
(2) that the course ol evolution, and the struggle of
group against group, has produced a strong social
. instinct in mankind, so that, directly and indirectly,
the pleasure of tho individual lies in forwerding the
prosperity of the society of which he is a member.
Corporate Society-the State, not the personified
Humanity of Positivism-becomes the centro of the
-Socialist’s saith. The polity of the Socialist is thus
his morality, and his reasoned morality may, in the
old sense of the word, be termed his religion. It is
this identity which places Socialism on a different
footing to the other political and social movements
of to-day.''*
, This elimination ol religious duty from the ethical
world seems to me a fatal defect in the socialistic
theory. I am content, however, to leave it uncriti·
oised. It could not be left altogether unindicated.
Socialism also sacrifices personal to sooial morality.
It ascribes to the conduct and habits of individuale
no moral character in themselves, hut only so fer as
they effect the happiness of society. It sees iu the
persona] virtues no intrinsic value, but only such
valuc as they may have when they happen to be

advantageous to the community. Utilitarianism
