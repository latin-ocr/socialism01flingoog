498 SOCIALISM

addressing congregatione composed oi the poor and laboun'ng
classes then those which meat in westminster Ahbey or the
Pari< Ohurch.

‘⁶ While there hes always been a call on the Ohurch to study
sociel questions, there is likewise, however, a special call on the
Ghuroh oi the present day ιο do so. For, indubitably, all over
Christendom there is o vast amount oi sochd rest and unroco.
The conflict between lubour and capital is one oi chronic wer, oi
violent end pessiouate struggles, which too often produce wide
spread waste and misery. And closely connected with it is e vast
irreligione and revolutionary movement, which sees in Christianity
its bitterest foe, and aims at destroying it along with social order
and private property. This irreligione and revolutionary move
ment is to e considerable extent the effect oi the confliot between
labour and capital, but it ie ιο an even greater exterw its cause

‘⁶ The matter standing thus, there is a most urgent call on the l
Ohuroh ιο etudy how to bring all the powers oi the Goepel ιο bear ,

against whatever is wrongin society, and on the stimulation ond ,

strengthening oi ell that is good in it. Thoughtfu'lnese need not
lessen or countereot zeel; it should acoompnny, enlighten, and
meist real. Ii there be an urgent ond strong call that the
Ohurch in present circumstances should endeavour ιο act, with all
the power with which God hes endowed her, ior the purification
and salmtion oi society, there must be e correspondingly urgent

end strong call ior her to etudy how she may most fully and
effectively do so.” '
