SOCIALISM AND SOCIAL ORGANISATION 275

Christianity emancipated the European mind. It
proposed to organise the definitive society of the
future according to the mediaeval pattern3 to entrust
the government of it to a temporal and spiritual
power—a patriciato and a olergy—the former
centring in a supreme triumvirate and the latter in
a supreme pontiff-and the two conjointly regulating
the whole lives, bodily and mental, affective and
active, private and public, in minuto conformity to
the creed of Comte3 and even, while forbidding
belief in the existence of God and of the immortality
of the soul, to impose avaried and elaborate worship.
It is unnecessary to criticise such a system, although
it is notewo1thy as an almost unique attempt to
accomplish the task incumbent on Socialism as a
theory of social organisation.

Socialism generally concerns itself mainly or ex-
clusively with the organisation of industry. But it
manifestly thereby forfeits all claim to be considered
an adequate theory of society, if society really has
a religious, ethical, aesthetio, and intellectual work
to do as well as an economic one; if it requires to
organice its science and specidation‚ its art and
literature, its law and morals, its faith and worship,
equally with its labour and wealth. When Social-

ism confines itself, as it commonly does, to the spherc

of industry, it can only prove itself to be a sufficient
and 'satisfactory theory of social organisation by
proving that there issar less in society to organico
than is generally supposed3 that men “live by
broad alone,” and need only such advantages as
wealth properly distributed will procuro for them;
