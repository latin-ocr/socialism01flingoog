20 SOCIALISM

All definitione of Socialism which characterise it
by any feature not essential and peculiar are
necessarily futile and misleading. The following is
a specimen of the class: “Socialism is a theory of
social evolution, based on a new principle of economic
organisation, according to which industry should be
carried on by cooperative workers jointly controlling

the means of production.'’ ³* Here Socialism is
identified with industrial partnership, which is
certainly not “a new principle of economio organisa-
tion ; ” andin which there is, properly speaking,
nothing whatever of a socialistic nature.

J. S. Mill's definition may seem to resemble the
preceding, but is in reality essentially different:
‘¹ Socialism is any system which requires that the
land and the 'instrumente of productiori should be
the property, not of individuale, but of communities
or associations, or of the Government.''† This defini·
tion is defective, inasmuch as it does not apply, as
Mr. Mill himself admitted, to Oommunisn, which is
the most thorough-going Socialism, the entire
abolition of private property. It is, however, a
good and honest definition so far as it extends, or
was meant to extend. It expressly states that
Socialism not merely favours industrial partnership,
bnt recognises no other form of economie organisa-
tion as legitimate, and accordingly demands the
suppression of all individual property in the means
of production.
