124 SOCIALISM

protecticn. The real opposite of competition or
liberty is compulsion or slavery, the authoritative
assignment to each man of the work which he has
to do. This is what genuine Sooislism, what
Collectivism, proffers us. This is its distinctiva
principle; it is also its decisivo condemnation. It
means robbing man of his true sels, of what gives to
his soul and conduct dignity and worth. It is
treating man as a thing or a beast, notas a person.
The organisation of labour, or of society, thus to bc
obtained would be dearly bought whatever might
be the material advantages which it conferred.
These advantages would probably be very few
and slight, and the disadvantages numerous and
enormous. ,
Socialists dwell on what they regard as the ’
injustice ol the rate of weges being fixed by compe·
tition according to the proportion ol‘ supply and
demand. The truth is that if the rate were exaotly
fixed between real supply and demand, it would
be quite justly fixed. Injustioe comes in because
itis often not so fixed. Absolute justice is difficolt
to obtain in this world. Who hopes to see a perfectly
just income-tax? Is there any bargain, any at least
not of the very simplest kind, in which one of the
parties does not get more and the other less than is
exaotly right? I have no doubt that labourers have
osten the worst of it in their contracts with capital-
ists, and would approve whatever can aid them to
get their proper share of the produce of industry.
But to encourage them to quarrel with the law of
supply and demand, instead of to study its opera·
