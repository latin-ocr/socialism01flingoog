The antithesis of Individualism ond Socislismis fundamental
in politics end politicsl history. The aim oi true politice is to
eliminato and reject what is erroneous end excessivo both in
Political Individualism sud Politicsl Socielism, and to accept,
develop, and conciliate what is true in both. Each of them,
it must be observed, not only does positive injustice to the truth
which is in the other, but oleo necessarily imperfect justice to
thetruth which isin itself. Politicsl Individualism robe society,
' but thereby impoverishes the individual. Politicol Socialism
repressos the liberty of tho individuel, but thereby seps the
strength oi the State. This is what is meant by those who
have said thet Iadiciduolism is the tue Sociolism, os well ss
by those who have pronounced Sociolrbm to be the true Indi·
uidualism. It is to be regretted that they could not find a less
absurd modo oi giving expression to so very sound ond certain e
thought. How politioel eud general history has moved through-
out the world, end from sgs to age, between the individualistio
ond socislistic extremes, hes been shown in s masterly manner

by the leto Fr. Laurentes Ghent,in the eighteen volumes ol .

his “Etndes sur l’Histoire de l'Humanitd.” laurent always
uses the terme Individuelism end Socialism in whst seems to
me a consistent wsy; ond certainly no ons has shown so clearly

and fully the reasons which history supplies to wsrn natione to
beware oi both Politicol Individunlism end Politicsl Socialism. *

‘⁴ society,” is merely an aggregate or majority ol individuale, assumed to
be entitled to suppress individnsl liberty in order to obtain, as iar as
possible, equality ol individnal enjoyment. Ethically, socialism is an
individunllstic equmtsnan hedonism. ln the sense in which indivi-
dualism and Socialism ere opposite extremes thoy ors extremes which
meet in Ansrchism, which, pruotioally, regards every person ss entitled

alike to enioy absolute liberty as an individnsl end to exorciso the entire
authority ol society.

⁵ There is also a proiound discussion ol both in tbe lonrth book of
Professor Oarls's “Vite del Diritto.'’ hir. Wordsworth Donisthorpe hss
given ns s prolessedly indlvidnalistio theory of politior ln his sbls trestise
“ Indiuidnalismt A system oi Politics,” 1889. He effectively ussalls. how·
ever, ‘⁸ extreme Individuallsts”; and, perhaps, no economlst not s Socislist
accepts so fully tho ordinary socialistic teechiug regsrding ‘⁴ the iron law ”
and the evil ellects ol the wago-system. He ls vigorons and ingenious,
especially in his ofidelem. ‘
