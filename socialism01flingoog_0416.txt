SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 415

that it would be difficult to prove that it oould be
made effective even in the collectivist era. In my
opinion that would be very difficult indeed to
prove*

The right to labour as understood by Sooialists
finds no support in the idea or sense of justice. The
olaim to be unhindered in the search for labour and
in the exeroise of one’s powers of labour for one’s
own advantage is manifestly just. The claim to be

⁴ In an article on “The Right to Labour‚” published in the May and
June numbers oi The Free Beoiew, hlr. J. Τ. Blanchard makes a praise-
worthy attempt to show undar what conditione the right to labour ean be
made effective iu the Sooislistio regime. He regards them as these three:

(ι) ile propinq uliliaotion os all thesoroea os nutare, indudiap land,-

(2) A ποίει reputatam of the birth-rate; and

(3) A trideainp usmaitau. aa increase in the demaudfor paeda.

As to (ι), Mr. Blanchard has torgotten ιο deal with the arguments oi
those who contenti that under a rtgime which would suppress individual
initiative and entarprise, and dispepse with motivas ιο parsonal exertior
to tha extem that Collectivism inevitably must, the utilisation oi the forces
of nature would prooeed more slowly than now. This is a larga and serious
omission,

Aeto (2), most Sooislists will probably be surprised and disappointed to
hear that any regulation oi the birth-rate will be needed in the collectiviat

era. What surprises aud disappoints me ls that Mr. Blanohard should not
have told us what he means by '‘awise regulation ot tha birth-rate.'' Can
any other regulation of it be wise than suoh as may be elieoted through so
moralising men aud women that they will bs habitually aelf-restraining,
prudent, and right-mindaii If lllr. Blanohard means by “wise regulation’*
what some of his collaborateurs-what the members oi tha Malthusian
League and many Sooialists-mean by it, it is what would lead to the
most shooking demoralisation oi tha labouring classes. Like hlr. Blanohard,
1 aooept every essentia] proposition contained in the theory ot Malthus.
But Malthus would have disowned with horror the Malthusian Ieague.

As ιο (3), Mr. Blanohard does not seem ιο realisa that consumption is
conditioned and limited by production3 that markets cannot be widened
ad tritum that an effective demand ior goods isone which implies
possession of the means oi paying for them. Ilailure to pereeive this

elementary truth is often apparent in the writings and reasonings os
Socialists.
