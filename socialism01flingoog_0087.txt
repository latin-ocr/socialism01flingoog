84 SOCIALISM

not a word need be spent (“ iiber dem hein Wort zu verlieren
iet”). But this is a grem mistake. The history of (iom-
muniem is rich in instruction, not only for studente of human
nature, but even of economics. It may be doubted if other
Socialiets have any economic doctrines which they heve not derived
in some measure from the Communists. All truly socialistic
eystems logically gravitate towards communiam. While oom-
munistic experimenta heve failed to attain their more ambitious
aime, they have been fairly fruitfnl of lessons. They have even
sufficiently shown that, under oertmn conditione, communistis
societies can acquire a considerable amount of wealth.

The chief conditione are the two already specilied (pp. 58-61),
nemely, a small membership and a strict discipline. But there
are others-ep, religion, restrictiori of population, and capable
leadership. Communistic societies have never long enjoyed much
material success except when animated by some kind of religione
real. ln America only the religione communitior—such as those
of Beizel, Rapp, the Shahers, the Snowbergers, Zoar, Ebenezer,
and daneon-have grown rich. Another feature distinctive of ¹
the communitior which have materially prospered isthat their·
membershave been either celibetes or “practioal Malthusians.”
The family ae it existe in ordinary Christian society is an effective
barrier ιο the success of Communism, rendering impossible that
separation from general society and those sacrifices which it

demands. The influence of leadership on the prosperity of¹ ¹

communistic bodiesis easily tracesble. The death of their
founders bas been in a large proportion of cases followed by the·
cessation or decline of their temporery sameas.

The prosperity of communietic societies bas been almost exele·-
sively of a material kind. They have given ιο the world no·
eminent men. They have done nothing lor learning, science, or
art. Their separation of themselves from the society around
them bas rendered them incapable of benefiting it. The oppo-
sition between their intereste and those of bealthy family life is·

equivalent ιο their being essentially antisocial. “The com·
munistic spirit, aa distinguished from the sociaiietic, is indifferent
to the good ol the family, or hostile ιο it, and makes use of the
power of society for its own protection, without doing anything
for society in returns If a whole natiou were mvided up into
