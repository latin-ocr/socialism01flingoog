The economic doctrine of Social Democracy is
thoroughly anti-scientific wherever it is peculiar 01·
distinctiva. It has been widely accepted, but only

by those who were predisposed and anxious to believe ’

it; not by impartial and competent economists‚ or
any other studente of it who have made their assent
dependent on proof. lt owes its success not to the
validity of the reasons advanced for its doctrines, but
to the wide-spread dissatisfaction of the working·
classes with their condition; or, as Dr. Bonar ex-
presses it, to their “ belief that they are now the
tools of the other classes and yet worth all the
rest.'' ⁴*

This state of feeling, however it may be accounted
for, is of itself a very serious fact, and will be lightly
regarded only by the foolish. Whatever is just and
reasonable init should find a generous response. For

whatever is pathological init, an appropriate remedy
should be sought. Its prevalence should produce
general anxiety for the material, intellectuel‚ and
moral amelioration of the classes in which it

threatens to become chronic. But it will never be
either satisfied or cured by concessione t0, or applica·
tione of, the economic nostrums of Social Democracy.
To fancy that it will is the same absurdity as to
imagine that a fevered patient may be restored to
restfulness and health by complying with the dis·
tempered cravings and exciting and confirming the

delirious illusione which are the effecte and symptoms
of his malady.
