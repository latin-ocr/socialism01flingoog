duction is inconceivable, or at least any system that would even
distantly approach in efficienoy the capitalistio system of today.
But democratic equality cannot tolerato such strong rewerds and
punishments. The scele of remuneration in the existing civil
and military systems would be among the very first things Sdoial
Democracy would overthrow, and rightly, according to its prin-
ciplss. So long as men ars not incipient anguls—and that will
be for· a good while yet-democratia collective production can
never melre good its promises, because it will not tolerate the

· 5. Social Democraeyis utterly unable to fulfil its promise of
strictly apportioning to each person the exect velue of ths
productos his socisl labour. It has discovered no principle or
method of determining what s “fair wage” is. So ier from
preventing exploitation it could not fail todo injustice to those
whose average productivenoss is higher then that oi their neigh-

falls to keep its promise. For, however socinlly useful this pro-
portional remuneration be, and however little any continuous
edvance in civilisation can be made without its enforcements, the
principle is still undeniably aristocratic, and totally incompatible
with a one-sidsd democratic equality. “A Social Democrsoy
which once admitted this principle would no longer be a demo

7. Oollsctivist Sociclism further promises the distribution ol
the product in a brotherly fsshion according to nands. But this
is not consistent with the promise oi distribution according to
