126 SOCIALISM

take from men according to their abilities and give
to them according to their needs. He did not
explain what he meant by a want, or what wants
he meant. But whatever he meant, we may be sure
that if his formula were to be acted on in any
society, abilities would decresse and wants increase
in that society in a very remarkable manner.

Karl Marx, as I have previously mentioned,
maintains that the volae os work should be esti·
maced accordinq to the quantity os sociollq neces·
corp lobour suspended, or, in equivalent ternus,
according to the time which must be on the oceraqe
occupied in the work. There is neither reasonable·
ness nor justice in this view. Mene expenditure of
labour does not produce! any velue, and is not
entitled to any remuneration. A man may labour
long and hard in producing something in which
nobody can see any use or beauty. If he do so he
will get nothing for his labour, and he has no right
to expect anything for it. He may expend ten
hours' labour in producing what there is so little
demand for that he will get merely the pay of one
hour’s work for it. If he say that this is not fair ;
that as it has cost him ten hours’ work it is worth
ten hours’ work; he will be told that it is only
worth that in his eyes, and because he has wasted
nine hours' work upon it. It is impossible to
eliminate from the determination of value the
elementa ol use, demand, rarity, limitation, and to
fix it exclusively by quantity or duration of labour.

Resides, the doctrine of Marx leaves out of

account the infinite differences of quality in labour,
