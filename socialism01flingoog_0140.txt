gained intellectuelly but lost morully. Under the manipulation
oi Merx end Iessnlle ond their successore the spirit oi justice end
oi humcnity which characterised it es presented by French
Socieliste from srintSimon to Louis Blonc was expelled from it,
und it is now everywhere a morelly inferior thing to what it wos
in its earlier phuees.

A fundamental pert oi the teuching oi Marx is his theory oi
sociel development. The general thesis in which the theory moy s
be eummed up is stated by his friend Engels, thus: “The ε
muterielist conception of history sterts from the proposition thet ζ
the productior oi the means to support humen life, und, next to
production, the erohenge oi things produced, is the bueis oi ell
eooiel structure3 thet in every society thet hee uppenrod in
history, the manner in which weelth is distributed ond society
divided into classes or orders, is dependent upon what is pro-
duced, how itis produced, end how the products ere exchunged.
From thie point oi view the finel ceusee oi cll sooiel changes end
politicul revolutione ure to be sought, not in men'e breins, not in
mun's better insight into eternul truth end justice, but in changes
in the modes oi production ond erchenge. They ure to be sought,
not in the philoeopiy, but in the ecmwmice oi each particular
epoch. The growing perception thet existing sooiul institutione
ure unreesonsble end enicet, thet reason hue become unmeson,
end right wrong,is only prooi thet in the modes oi production

ι ond exchenge chungee heve silently taken place, with which the
occul order, adopted to earlier economic conditionsie no longor
in lreeping. From this it oleo follows thot the meone oi getting
rid oi the incongrnities thot heve been brought to light, must

eleo be present, in o more or less developed condition, within the
changed modes oi production themselves. These meone ere not to
be invented by deduction from fundamental principles, but ero
to be discovered in the stubborn ioots oi the existing system ol
production.” ⁹

What is true in this theoryis thet the economic factore of
