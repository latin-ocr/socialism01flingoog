raa Choreb desererer, edited by 110 Rev. Stewart D. Hennam,
is(only in part) the organ of the Guild of St. Matthew. This
Guild, founded by Mr. Headlam, hae for objecto :-“ 1. To get
rid, by every possible means, of the existing prejudices‚ espe-
cially on the part 01 ‘soeunnsts’ against the Ohurch, her Sacra·
ments and Doctrines; and to endeavour ‘to justify God to the
people.’ 2. Το promote frequent ond roverent worship in the

Holy Communion, and a better observance of the tecching of the
(lhurch of England aa set forth in the Book of Oommon Prayer.
3. To promote the study 01 Sosin and Political Questions in the
light 01 110 Incarnation.” If the viewe of the members of the
Guild are even in general accordanoe with 11000 01 110 editor and
chief contributors to 110 Choreb Reformer there can be no more
reasonable doubt of the genuineness of their Socialism then of
their Sacerdotaliam. Mr. Headlem and his friends are naturally
much occupied at present with the question of Dieestablishment.
Theyoppose the Disertabliahment policy of 110 liberationists, not
only on the ground of its selfishneas and unspirituality‚ but also

of its inadequacy and incompleteness. What they themselves ’

demand is a liberatior of the Ohurch from Mammon and Oaste;
that the Ohurch shall be treated as a universal brotherhood 01
equale, a spiritual democracy, in which all baptised are entitled to
a share in the electior of their bishops and clergy; that patronage
in all forms shall be abolished; and that all endowments and
property shall be nationalised without any distinction between
Ohurch or other property, or between the property 01 one Ohurch
and another. Iandowners they would get n'd of by taxation which
is to rise by degreee till it reaches ros. in the pound. “As 101·
compensation,'' says Mr. Headlam, “from the point of view 01
110 highest Christian morality‚ it is the landlords who should
compensate the people, not the people the landlords. But proc·
tically, if you 0011] out this reform by taxation, no compensation
would be necemary or even possible ” (“ Christian Socinlism,’'
