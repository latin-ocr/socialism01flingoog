THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 241

101 what they do. But this is itself abjeot slavery,
to which no 1000 01 111110110011001 011011 would submit
00 long 00 there was in the world 0 free country 10
which 110 oould esospe.

Then, what guarantees have 0011001111010 to give
us 11101 men would be 00 free as they ought to be
even 00 regards consumption, that is spending
and enjoying what they heve earnedl Nono. The
Collectivist State would be the sole produoer, 01111
every individual would have to take just what it
pleased to produce. At present demand rules supply ;
in the oolleotivist system supply would rule demand.
The State might have the most 001111010υο views 00
10 what people should 001 01 drink, how they should
dress, what books they should read, and the like3

end drink, the sole manufacturer 01 eloth end sole
tailoring end dressmaking 0010111101110001, the sole
publisher 0011 supplier 01 books, individuals would
have to submit to all 110001111000. The promised
freedom of enjoyment or oonsumption would thus, in
all probability, be very slight and illusory.

Were 011 powers 0000001101011 10 the State 00 Col·
leotivism proposes, the temptetion to ebuse these
powers would be enormous The mere 1001, 101
0110011110,11101011 printing 0011 publishing would be
done by the State could hardly 1011 10 be fetel 10 the
freedom 01 the press. Were Seoulerists in power they
oould not oonsistently encourage the 01100101100 01
worke of devotion or of religious propagandism. If
Christiane held offioe they would naturally regerd
the publication 01 writings hostile 10 their religion 00
