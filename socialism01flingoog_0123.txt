120 SOCIALISM

freedom and general liberty the members of the
State enjoy‚ not the less but the more scope and
need are there for the ethical superintendence and
intervention of the State. Those who suppose that
an ample and practical recognition of the ethical
character and functione of the State is a distinctive
feature of Socialism, or is incompatible with approval
of the competition inseparable from industrial free·
dom, are utterly mistaken.

Again, wherever competition prevails some must
succeed and others fail, some will be at the front
and others in the rear. This does not imply that
those who fail or fall behind will be absolutely
worse off than they would have been had no come
petition existed. There may be universal com·
petition and yet universal improvement. After =
seventy years of industrial and capitahst competi-
tion in this country, pauperiem is not found to have
grown in proportion either to wealth or population;
it is found to have greatly decreased relatively to
both. Seventy years ago there were as many
paupers in London as there are now, although
it has more than tripled its population in the
interval. During the last twenty-five years, “the
machinery epoch‚'' in which competition has been
at its keenest, labour has been better remunerated.
relatively to capital than at any former epoch, and
the general improvement in the condition of the
labouring population hasbeen most marked. Com·
petition is not the direct or necessary cause of
poverty, misery, or crime, and its suppression would
not be their removal.
