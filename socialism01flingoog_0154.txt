How does he from this source drsw surplus-vuluel Thus,
according ιο Marx, lehem-power, the source oi ell velue, iteeli
possesses s velue. What valuel Like sll commodities, the velue
oi the sociul normal labour-time incorporated in it, or necessary
ιο its reproduction5 in this cese, the velue oi the means oi sub.
detence necessary to the maintenance oi the labourer. If six
hours oi average socisl labour be sufficient ιο provide the
labourer with the physicslly indispeuseble means oi subsisteuce,
and the velue of these means be represented by three shillings,
these three shillings correctly represent the velue oi the labour-
power put forth by the labourer during u working-day ol six
hours. This sum the capitalist gives, aud must give, to the
labourer. There is, therefore, still no surpluswulue. 'l'he
cepitslist hes peid away just as much es he hss received; the
labourer hae put into the product in which hiswork is incorporated
no more than thet work hes eost.

This, oi course, does not setislythe capitalist. But he sees
that the Isbourer con produce more than he coste: that he ran
lsbour twelve hours instead of six, yet maintain himself each day
in working efficienoy aud renew his vital powers on three shillings,
the equivalent of the velue of six horus. Accordingly he compels
the labourerto work for him twelve hours instead oi six at the
price oi six, and appropriatos the value created by the labourer
during the six extra hcurs. Capitulrsticprqfit iseimply tlte aspha
