Australis were hardly more entitled to be called the

Australis, for they had only, like the kangaroos,

among them had made something like a gardan of
any portion of Australian soil his title to that piecs
of ground would have been much superior to that of
his tribe to the hundreds of miles over which its
members sought for their food.
