138 SOCIALISM

history have at all times hed a grem influence on the general
development oi history; and that in all stages oi the movement
oi human society there have been a correspondenoe and congruity
between tha character and organisation of industry and the
character and organisation oi law, politice, sciente, art, and
religion. 1t is very important truth, but not truth which Mr-
been leit to Marx to discover cr even te do justice to. Many
authors before him hed indicated and illustrated it3 and one,
especially, Auguste Oomte, the founder of Positivism, hed
exhibited the relations and significanoe ol it withan insight
and comprehensiveness tc which there is nothing akin in the
treatment oi it hy Marx. Where alone Marx did memorable
work as an Qtndmkthechs in his anelysis and interpreta-
tion of the capitelist era, and there ha must be admitted to have
rendered eminent service even by those who think his analysis
more subtle than accurate, and his interpretation more ingenious
than true. When he imagined that history could be completely
accounted ior by its economic factore—that modes oi productiori
and exchange generated hostile classes from whose antagonism -
'and conflicta arose all the changes, institutione, and ideas of
society—he greatly deceived himself, and ignored and rejected
hosts oi facts which testiiy against so narrow and exclusive a

conception. The causes oi his thus erring were two: an nn-
proved assumption ol the truth oi materialism‚ and a dauney
find some sort oi philosophical and historioal basis lor his social-
istic agitation. His relationship to Hegel determined the form
the error assumed, and the method oi its evolution into a
philosophy. The historical philosophy ol Marx was reached
mainly by the rough and ready process of turning Hegel’s upside

down, and retaining the Hegelian dialectic to so slight an extent
that it came to look to Marx as a dialectic oi his own “funda-
mentally different from Hegel’s, and even its direct opposite.¹'

Socialists‚I shall require careiully te examine in a forthcoming
