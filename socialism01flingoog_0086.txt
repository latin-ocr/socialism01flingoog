communiam hes always, and very naturally, shown itself hostile
to the family. In what Noyes represents as the highest degree
of Communism the family is abolished.

Similarly, the third degree of his communiam annuls the
second. The doing away with private property must overthrow
the ‘⁶ publio institutione of harmony and benevolente supported
by it.'’ His last two degrees are, in faot, alone properly eom·
munistie; and they are so just beoause they contradict and
violate the truths in the two first.

In Professor Wagner’s opinion, ‘⁴ the only scientifio aooeptetion

or, let us say, quite aware of the looseness of the rendering,
common management. “Every other ‘sense’ of the word,'’ he
adds, is ‘⁶ nonsense.'' Then he proceeds to illustrate his definition
by informing us that the State in its administration of the publio
finanees is an example of communiam andjthat the post offioe,
telegraphio and railway systema, deo, when under State direction,

Such a view is confused and misleading, Communists have

always meant by Communism, not merely common management
in general, any sort of common management of property with a
view to productiora and advantage, but definitely the management
of the property of a eommunity'by the eommunity itself, and
with all its members on terme of equality. 'l'hey have never
ooneeived of it as management by departmental officials under
the conhol of a king or parliament. They have never imagined

anything so absurd as that they oould vindieate their claim to be

heading their property over to be managed by a ruling indi-
vidua] or oleae. Communism, properly sooalled—“ common
management ’¹ in the eommunistio sense-is almost as incon·
sistent with State management as with private management.
Having fallen into the error indioated, it wae natural that

Professor Wagner should regurd Oommunism, in the ordinary
and proper aooeptation of the term, ea a phenomenon on whieh
