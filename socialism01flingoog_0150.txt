When lnbour enters lorgely, in comperison with other lectore,
into the production oi commodities ior which there is e stesdy
demand it will hove e relatively decisivo influenoe on their velue.
When there is no monopoly, no need ior expensive machinery,
end un abundent supply oi chenp materiale on which to operate,
weges msy be fer the lsrgest iterus in the eost oi productim, end
the lsbour expended on commodities may nearly measure their
velue. But lsbour elone never really messores velue, never being
elone in determining the eost of productior, end eost oi produc·
tion itself never clone determining thevelue of products. Lehour
itself must be supported with capitol, requires tools, end oennot
dispense with meteriels seldom, ii ever, procureble ior obsolutely
nothing. And, above sll, selue is not en absolute objective thing,

attributes to them uo merite, nllows them no rights to remunere-
