SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 349

confer great benefit on society by doing so.
Economic Ethics is a very necessary and important
branchos instruction at the present day. Obviously
it is one which can only be properly taught by those
who have studied Economics with sufficient care
and without prejudice.

Itis not scientific Economists but certain Social-
ists of asentimentai type who have either taught
or implied that wealth is the satisfaction of all
wenta, or the chief ond of life, or even in any
instance or reference an end in itself. No genuine
Economist has been so foolish as to inculcata or
suggest that what he calls wealth, however abund-
antly produced or wisely distributed it may be, is
necessarily creative either of wealth or of virtue*

⁴* The error 10 which reference is made has not, perhaps, been related
better hy any subsequent economist than by Pelegrino 110101 111 the
second lecture 01 his “Oours d'lloonomie Politique ” (1840). Ae the point
is a not unimportant ona, either in itseli or in the controversy‘betveen
economists and socialists,1 shall here summense his argument: “wealth,
material prosperity, and moral development, although not unrelated, ars
not necessarily conjoined or unhormly connected. The poverty or wealth

worth. Auiti· with individuale soisit with natione. Δ poor State may

and general prosperity 01 0 people may be great while 110 morel develop-
ment is most 1001110111. The working classes 01 0 country may be com·
iorteble and contented, their means 01 living cheap, aud 01 enjoyment
abundant, yet in 11101 country the intellectual aad moral laculties 01 men
