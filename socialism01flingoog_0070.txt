IN DIVIDUALISM 67

than physicians are called in to free individuale of
sickness, but not tc help them to get well. In all
the functione of government the productiori of good
and the prevention of evil are inseparable, and they
are equally legitimate aima of action.

Furtber, the socalled “principle” while seem-
ingly definite, is in reality utterly vague. All vices
inevitably injure not only those who indulge in
them, but cause suffering to those who do not.
There arc few, if any, actions which are purely
sels-regarding. It is just because of the amount of
harm which drunkeuness produces that a class of
social reformare desire to put an end to all liberty
to make use of strong driuks. ΜΓ. Mill of course
opposed their proposals, but it was certainly not by
adhering to his “ one simple principle.'’ 'lbet
principle can be no effective barrier to encroach·
ments on individual liberty, to over-legislation, to
social despotism.

At present Mr. Spencer is generally regarded by
Individualists as a safer and more consistent guido
than was Mr. Mill. And his “Man versus The
State '' is undoubtedly a most vigorous and oppor-
tune assault on excessivo State intervention. While
I regard it as one·sided and exaggerated in some of
its charges, and seriously at ferilt on certain points,
Iadmire it in the main as not only a valuable book
buta brave and excellent action.

- I cannot perceive, however, thatin it or any
other of his works Mr. Spencer has established any

aelf-consistent or practicel system of Individualism.
