above said, as 'solutions cf social wrongs, bnt as tending to lessen the
evils ci the existing replica· so that individuale of the usefnl classes,
haring mora leisnre and less anxiety, may be able to tom their attention
to the only real remedy for their position oi inferiority-to wit, the
supplanting oi the present state by a society oi equality oi condition.
When this great change is completely carried cot, the genuine liberty of
