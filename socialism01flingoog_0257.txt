society. It has done good service by insisting on
the need for more and better social organisation. It
was especially by the boldness and keenncss of their
criticism of the actual constitution of society that
the founders of modern Socialism-Saint-Simon,
F ourier, and Owen-drcw attention to themselves,
and gained a hearing for their proposals. And so
has it been with their successore It is largely
because of the amount of truth in their teaohing as
to the prevalence of disorder and anarchy, diseese
and misery in society, that their views have obtained
so large a measure of sympathy and success.

Nor is this other than natural, seeing that society
isreally in every orgen, portion, and department ofit

profession without either just grievances or unjust
privileges. Land is, in general, poorly remunerativo
to its proprietors; farming is precarious: and agri-
cultural labourers are depressed and discontented
not without reasons. The war between labour and
capital becomes increasingly embittcred and danger·

a few occupations men and women are working far
