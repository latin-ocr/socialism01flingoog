lectivism would act through the regulation of pro-
duction, through refraining from ministering to any
desire for what it deemed luxury. Its greater
power in this respect, however, would probably turn
out to be simply a gremer power for mischief.
Luxury is so essentially relative and so extremely
variable in its character and effecte, that it is not a
proper or safe subject for legislation. Attempts to
suppress it by law are likely to do more herm than
good by destroying stimuli to economic exertion and
progress with which society cannot dispensa. Even
if it were suppressed the saving effected would be
much less than Collectivists hope for, as far less
labour is spent in the productiori of objects of
luxury than they obviously fancy to be the case.
In Britain it is only about a thirtieth part of the
labour employed in productiori. In Franco it is
more, about a twentieth. But then France makes
objects of luxury for all the world3 and she does so
very much to her own advantage. A Parisian
producer of articles de luae indirectly acquires for
Franco twice as much wheat as he would raise if he
actually cultivated French soil. There would be
more of the means of sustenanoe in Ireland if fewer
of her inhabitants were occupied in cultivating
potatoes and more in producing objecto of luxury.
Two strong reasons can be given for holding that
were the system of Collectivism adopted the day of
labour in this country would not be a short oue,
and that our production would be insufficieut to
