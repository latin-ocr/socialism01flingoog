01 labour to bathe only and the adaquata measure of the magni-

tude and proportione 01 velue. Butae hebes completely failed
to pmve labour the source 01 velue, he has left his doctrine that
itis the measure 01 velue, 11118118 in the air, without any basis
or support.

Γ1111111 very unfortunate 101 11, especially es there 11 101 only
no natural probability in 111 favour, but intrinsic unreasonableness
ieplainly stamped upon it. Labour itself varies in velue with
the fluctuatione 01 demand and supply. An bour of common
manual 1011 may be worth 1 few penos per working day in India,
a shilling in Ireland, three or four shilllngs in England, and six
or seven shillings in certain districts of the United States. In
all 1111111 the value 01 labour is liable to 1111 and 1111 from one
short period to another, sometimes 11011 week 10 weelr, or even
from day to day. And there are unfortunately'times and places
where it has no velue, or almost no valae at all. It varies from
the action and interaotion 01 1 great number of causes and 1111111·
stanoes, many 01 which may be in themselves independent and
uncouneoted. How can what thus varies be an unvarying

'l'o say that the same quantity or duration 01 labour always
implies the same exertior, trouble, or sacrifice on the part 01 the
labourere, and 11 therefore to be regarded 11 always 01 the same
velue, is a quite futile attempt 11 dafenes 01 theMarxian position.
Por, in the first place, what is alleged is not correct. Men

velue 01 their lsbour in that time. In the second place, it has,
fortunately 101 the welfare 01 mankind, not been exclusively 1111

1111811 what prices they please to their products, to sellers to
