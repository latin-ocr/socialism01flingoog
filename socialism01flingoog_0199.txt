196 SOCIALISM

which Ihave already stated on pp. 67-8, my remarks will be very
brief.

r. The charge which Marx brings against the capitalist, of
striving to appropriate more and more of the productiva power
oi labour by lengthening the labour day is, of course, one in
which there is a considerable measure of truth. All that he
blames the capitalist for having done with this intent he shows
from unexceptionable authorities that the capitalist had actually
done. Unquestionably the desire of the capitalist to extend ae
much as he can the labour day is one against which labourers do
well to be on their guard, and which they are justified in
endeavouring to thwart whenever it demands what is unreaeon-
able. Experience proves that with prudence, firmnese, aud
unior, they can do so; and that Marx was quite mistaken in
thinking that the capitaliet must be successful in his attempta to
overstep “the moral eud even the merely physical maximum
bounds of the working day.'' Machinery has not helped the
capitalist to attain that end. Fora time, indeed, when social
continuity was violently disrupted and industry largely dis
organised by ite sudden and rapid introductiou, it seemed as if it
would do so; but it has had, in reality‚ a contrary effect. Owing
to condensing population within narrow circuite, and associating
intelligences and forces, the large manufacturing system is just
what has rendered possible the rise and growth of powerful

trade unione, and has transferred political power from the hands
of employers to those of the employed. Hence there has been
within the last thirty years, aud especially in large industries, a
notable shortening of the working day. At the present time the
average working week consiste of not more than fifty hours.

Thus already workmen have very generally aa much leisure time
as labour time. The labour time will doubtless be still further

abbreviated, and for all chesas of workmen. When this takes
place, what is even now a very important question for workmen
that as to the right use of their leisure time, will become the
chief question.

2. The charge that the capitalist contrives by the aid of
machinery so to intensify labour as to compensate him for any
loss incurred by shortening its duration, is also not without a
'certain amount of truth. Iabour may be excessive without
