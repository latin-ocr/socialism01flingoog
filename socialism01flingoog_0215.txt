SOCIALISM

was as good as that ofthe Narman State. Ifindividual
property in land then be unjust, we shall not escape
from injustice by taking refuge in national property

inland ; for it must be equally or more unjust‚ seeing
that it rests on the same or weaker grounds, end
has been effectuated in the same or worse ways
The only mode of escape from the alleged injustice
must be to allow of no property inland ; to have all
land unappropriated, free and open to all. But this
would render land useless, or nearly so. If every·
body is to have the same right to it nobody will get
any good of it. The earth, however, can hardly
have been designed to be useless. If, as Socialists
frequently remind us, God has made it for the good
of all, Hc cannot have so given it to all that it could
benefit none. And certainly it is only through land
becoming the property of some that it can become
profitable to all, or indeed of almost any use to any.
It cannot reasonably be doubted that individual
property in land was a decided advance and im·
provement on any of the forms of collective property
in land which preceded it. It would not otherwise
have everywhere displaced them in progressive
societies3 it would not otherwise have uniformly
accompanied the growth of civilisation. The collcc
tive tenure of land was once the general rule; now
it is the rare exception. Why? Because it was an
economically feeble and defective system; because
it cramped medem, depressed energy, limited produc·
tion, could not supply the wants of a large popula·
tion, and hindemd the accumulation ol capital
None of the objections against private property
