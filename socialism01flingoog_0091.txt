still ite “ Bible.” Ι

At this point I wish to give all due prominence to the cents-al
aud ruling idea of Social Democracy. This can bcstbedone,1
think, by quoting the words in which thet idea hes found
expression in the most authoritative documenta oi Socisl Demo
crecy,—ite chief manifestoes end progr-ammes. A considerable
subsidiary advantage will also thus be gained, as the reader will
have brought under his observation the most important portione
ol a number oi documents with which itis desirable that he
should bc to some extent acquainted. .
, The Manifesta os tlte chununiet Purty, drawn up hy Marx
and Engels in 1847 ,is the earliest and most celebrated oi these
documento-the first sud most vigoroue presentation ol the

does away with classes altogether, and by that very lact with its own
dominationes a class The place ol the tormer bourgeois society, with
lte classes and class contrasts, is taken by su associatlou ot workers, in
which the free development oi each is the condition oi the iree develop-
ment oi all.”

Next may be adduoed the Fundamental Pact or Statutes oi
the International Worlsmen’s Assooiation, drawn up by Marx
jn September, 1864 :—- ,
