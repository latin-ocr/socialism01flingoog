SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 377

into conflict with morality is none other than its
root-idea, its generativa error—a false conception
’ of the relation of individuals to society.

A true conception of the relation must be neither
individualistic nor socialistic.

It must not be individualistic. Society is not
merely the creation of individuale, or a means
to their sels-development; it is further so far
the very condition of their being, and the medium
in which they live materially, intellectually, and
morally. While the individua] has natural rights
independent of society and as against society, these
are not rights which imply “a state of nature ’'
anterior to society, but rights grounded in the con-
stitution of human nature itself. There are no
personal duties wholly without social references.
The mere individual, the individual entirely ab·
stracted from society, is, a pure abstractione non-
entity. The individualistic view of the relation of
man to society is, therefore, thoroughly false. η

Not more so, however, than the socialistic view.
It in no way follows that because the individual man
existe in and by society he is related to it only as
chemical elementa are related to the compounds
which they build up, or as cells to organisms, or as
the members of an animal body to the whole. Man
is not so related to society, for the simple reason that
heis a person, a free and moral being, or, in other
worda, a being whose law and end are, in himself, and
who can never be treated as a mere means either for
the accomplishment of the will of a higher being or
for the advantage of society without the perpetration
