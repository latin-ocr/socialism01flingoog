The view oi Marx is undoubtedly erroneous. Profits ere
deriveble from all the iactors of production, end not merely from
labour. Greeter disposabls weelth or purchesing power, superior
intelligente in buying‚ selling, and management, the possession oi
more poweriul or perfect machinery, and other advantages are
sufficient ιο explain why one manufacturer gethers fer more
simplus-velue then another,¹ although he neither employs more
labourers nor pays them worse. The masters who make most
profit seldom melre it by peying lower weges than their rivale.
Oould manufacturers dispenso with human lebour altogether, and
substitute for it the action oi automatic maehines, they would
aequiro surmus-velue not less then at present. Only on con-
dition of aequiring such velue would they consent to produce et
all. Profit and loss in business ere not proportionel ιο what
Marx cells the veriable capital but to tho totel capital employed
in it. Το ωοίοιοίο ιιο reverse implies blindness to the most
obvious end indubitable facts oi industrial end commercial life.
