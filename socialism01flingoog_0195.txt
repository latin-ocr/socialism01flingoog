consents to.

Further, Marx shows himself inconsiderate aud inconsistent
when he represents the capitelist ae appropriating to himself the
velue oi the six hcurs oi labour ior which he does not pay the
workmsn. Marx repeatedly recognises the truth ci the economic
law that “the value oi commodities tende to diminish as the
amount oi the product per unit of habeor-eost increases.” But it
isan obvious and necessary inierenoe from it thet the capitulist
would not, and could not, appropriate the valus oi the labour
which hs did not pay ior3 that the three shillings oi which he
sought to rob each labourer deily would not stay in his own
pocket but take to itseli wings and fly into the pocksts oi the
public by reducing the price oi commodities three shillings tc the
consumor.

The illustrative example by which Marx endeavours tc make
periectly plain to us how “the capitelistic trick” is performed
still remains ior consideration. It is iully presented in the
extract cn pp. 66-7. As I have alrecdy attempted to reiute all
the erroneous principles and suppositione which are expreoeed or
implied in thet extract, I shall now merely set over against it en
extract from an eminent American economist, which contains the
clearest and most conclusive exposure oi it that hes come under
my notice.

Mr. Gunton writes thus:

“Marx then tells ua the same amount ci labcor is expended on the
