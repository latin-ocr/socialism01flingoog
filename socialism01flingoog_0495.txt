10 relieve the misery and to redress the wrongs under which it
found society suffen'ng. In the early Christian centurias, 111 tha
time 01 the 1011 01 the Roman Empire and the formation 01 the
mediaeval world, in the so-called “ ages 01 101111,” and the epoch 01

When the (11111011 has kept 113011 10113011, when it bas shut 113011

been 11101033 and unprogreesive, its ministry 01 the Word sapless

“ The call 01 the Ghurch to study 300101 questions has 113 chief
