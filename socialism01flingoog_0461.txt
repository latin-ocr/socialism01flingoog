character for the better, and lessen its abuses. And
sofar asit does this, Christian men cannot fail to
weloome it as a practical manifestetion of the love
and brotherhood which their Religion demands; as a
confirmation through action of saith in the truth that
Christian society aa wellas the Christian Church
ought to be a body which God has so “tempered
together that there should be no schism in the body,
but that the members should have the same care one
for another, and whether one member suffereth‚ all
the members suffer with it, or whether one member
is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.”

I have now indicated some respecta in which ⁸
Christianity and Socialism must be regarded aa in
the main agreed, and must proceed to refer to some
respects in which they may be regarded as on the
whole opposed. The reference will be ol' the briefest
kind, aa most of the points have already been more
or less under consideration in other relations.

F irst, then, Socialism is antagonistic to Christian-
ity in so far as it rests on, or allies itself with,
Atheism or Materialism. It does so to a very large
extent. The only formidably powerful species of
Socialism is that which claime to be scientific on the
assumption that modern science has proved the
truth of the materialistic view of the universe and
'of history, and shown Christian and all other reli-
gious conceptione and beliefs to be delusione. Mani-
festly, however, to the extent that Socialism thus
identifies itself with an anti-religious Materialism,
it comes into conflict with Christianity; and the
struggle between them must be one of life and death.
