42 SOCIALISM

freedom and non-interference have become en·
thusiests for seir rents, State-eid, and State-inter·
vention. ·

The so-called Professorial Socialists of Germeny
have not got farther than our own governmentel
politiciane. There is e large section of them whose
alleged Socialism is simply the protectionism of
paternal government, the protectionism of Princo
. Bismarck‚ but which that astute stetesman naturally
preferred to call his Socielism when he eppeeled to
socialistie working-men. There is another large
section of them whose so-oalled Socialism consiste
in adopting a programme of political reformo similar
to thet which Mr. Chemherlein propounded in this
country in 1885. It rney be questioned, how·
ever, if there be one true Socialist among them.
They are simply State-interventionists of either a
Conservative or e Redical type. In calling them·
selves, or allowing themselves to be called, Socialists,
they ere seiling under false colours. Their views as
to property, labour, capital, profit, interest, dre, are
essentielly different from those of real Socialists.*
