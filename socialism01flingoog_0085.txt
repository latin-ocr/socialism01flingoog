82 SOCIALISM

Oommunism. Property belongs to life, and so far as you and I
have eonsciously one life, we must hold our goods in common.
If there be no such thing as unity cf life between a plurality of
persons, then there is no basis for Communiem, The Gom·
muniam which we find in families is certainly based on the
assumption, right or wrong, that there is actual unity of life
between husband and wife, and between parents and children.
The common law of England‚ ancl of most other countries, recog-
nisee onlya unit in the male and female head of each family.
The Bible declares man and wife to be ‘one lleshl Sexual
intercourse is generally supposed to be a symbol of more com·
plete unity in the interior life ; and children are supposed to be
branches of the one life of their parente. This theory ie
evidently the basis of family Communism. So also the basis
of Bible Communism is the theory that in Christ believers become
spiritually one; and the law ‘Thou ehalt love thy neighbour as
thyself' ie founded on the assumption that ‘thy neighbour' is,
or should be. a part of ‘thyself.' Praetically, Communium is a
thing cf degrees With a small amount of vital unity, (lom-
munism is possible only in the limited sphere oi fanrilism. With
more unity, public institutione of harmony and benevolence mdc
their appearance. With another degree of unity, Communism of
external property becomes possible, as among the Shalrers. With
still higher degrees, Communism may be introduced into the
sexual and propagative relations.” *

The view set forth in these words is wortby of being noted,
inasmuch as itis undoubtedly one ou which various communistis
societiee have been actually maed. It explains why such societies
have been characterised by their deplorable combination of spirit·
ualistic folly with carnal immorality.

Noyes is by no means singular in representing the family as a
stage of Communism. In reality, however, the family is an
exemplification of the true social community, which is incom-
patible with Communism3 the best type, in its normal state, of
the organic social unity which Communism would destroy. In
the family individualities are not suppressed, but supplemented;
personui relations are not confused, but harmonised 3 authority
