“Exebange velue, at iirst eight, presente iteeli as 0 quantitative relation,
00 the proportior in which valuee in uae 010110 sort are erchanged ior
those 01 another sort, a relation consiautly chenging with time and place.
Hence exchange valne appears to he something acoidental and purely
relative, and consequently au intrineic vulne-ie, an exchange velue that
is inseparably connected with, inherent in, commoditiee seems 0 contra·
diction in terme. Let ne consider the mutter 0 little more closely.

“A given commodity—e.p., 0 qnarter 01 wheat—ls erchanged for e
blaoking, g silk, or z gold, &oq in short, ior other commodities in the
most different proportione. Instead 01 010 exchange value, the wheut
hae, therefore, 0 great many. But since e blacking, y silk or z gold, 810,
each represent the erchangevalue 01 010 quarter 01 wheat, e blacking,
ysilk, agold, icc„ must, es erchenge valnes, be replaceable by each other,
or equal to each other. Thereiore,iirat,the valid erchangevelues 010
given commodity express something eqnu1; recondly‚ erchenge velue,
generally, 10 only the mode oi expression, the phenomenel 101111 01 eome-
thing contained in it, yet distinguishable 11010 11.

“ Let ue take two commoditiee-ep, corn and iron 'ibe proportione in
which they 010 exchengeebie, whatever those proportione mey be, can
always be represented by an equation in which 0 giren quantity oi corn
is equeted to some quantity oi iren-ap, 1 quarter corn = e ovvt. iron.

Whatdoesthisequationtelinsi itteilsue that in two different things Ἴ

-ln 1 quarter 01 corn end in e· ewt. oi iton-there existe in equal quan·
tities something common to both. The two things must therefore be
eqnal to 0 third, which in iteeli 10 neither the one nor the other. 11001101
them. so 101 00 11 10 exchange velue, must therefore be reducible to this

Ἣ simple geometrical illustration will 1110110 this clear. In order to

calculata and compare the areae 01 rectilinear ligures, we decompose them
into triangles But the area 01 the triangle itseli is expreseed by some·
thing totally different irom ite visible figure—namely, by hali the product
01 the base into the altitude. In the same way tbe excbange values 01
commoditIes must be capable 01 being expressed in terme 01 something
common to them 011, 01 which thing they represent a greater 011000
quantity.

“ 'l'hie com mon ‘something’ cannot be either a geometricnl, a chemical,
or any other natural property 01 commoditiee. Such properties claim our
attention only in eo iar 00 they aiiect the utility 01 those commodities,

make them use-valuee. But the exchange 01 commodities 10 evidently en ,

001 characterised by 0 total abstraction irem nsevainee. Then 01101100-
vaine is y'nst 00 good as another, provided only it be present in eudicient
quantity. Or, asold Barbon says, 'one sort 01 wareo are ae good 00
another, ii the valuee be eqnal. There ie no diiierence or distinction ln
