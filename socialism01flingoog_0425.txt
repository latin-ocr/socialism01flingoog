4²4 SOCIALISM

cessae, and only very partially, if at all, successful.
These who have gained rights which they have been
taught to think of as advantages, but not as
responsibilities‚ always abusa them. No society

in which men who have been thus perverted and
misled are in the majority, no society in which the
sense of duty does not prevail, can fail to be one
in which class is at constant war with class; can
enjoy peace, security, or prosperity.

This truth has found its worthiest prophet and
apostle in J oseph Mazzini; and to his matinga, and
especially to his work “On the Duties of Men‚”I
refer such of my readers as desire fully to realise its
significance. He rightly trecsd to disregard of it
much of the moral weakness and disorganisation of
that Democracy for the advance and triumph of
which he so unselfishly laboured; and he justly held
the one-sided moral tecching of the revolutionary
and socialistic propagandists os the age to have
been largely responsible for that disregard itself.
There has certainly been no improvement in this
respect since he wrote. The Socialism of to=dey is
more radica] and revolutionary in its proposals, more
intent on class and party advantages, and more averse
to dwell on the supreme and universal claims of duty
than were the forms in which Socialism appeared in
the earlier half of the century. The spirit which
animatas Social Democracy is the very spirit which
Mazzini was so anxious to see cast out ofDemocracy.
The Mazzinian and the Marxian ideals of democratic
society are moral contraries. Immense issues
depend on which of them may prevail.
