SOCIALISM ΑΝΙ) CAPITAL 161

influence of capital in production, Socialists have
naturally found it very diffictdt to find reasons for
their prejudices against it. Of late, however, some
attempta have been made to render plausible the
notion that capitalis, if not altogether inefficient as
a factor in productim, at least much less efficient
than is ordinarily supposed. All these attempta
necessarily take the form of argumente designed to
show that the various elementa of the eost of
production are paid not out of capital accumulated
by past saving, but out of the produce which
labour itself creatas. The conclusion sought to
be proved carries absurdity so plainly on the
fece of it that there is no wonder that most of
these attempts dropped almost instantaneously into
oblivien*

The only one, indeed, which has succeeded in

attracting general attention is that of ΜΓ. Henry

⁴* 'I'he eminent American ecenomist, Prot. Faucia Δ. walker, contende,
that ualthough wages are, ιο every considerable degree, ln all communi·
ties, cdeaaoed out oi capital, and this irem the very necessity ei the case,”
yet that they “must ln any philosophieai view of the subject be regardedae
poid out of the product oi canent industry.” While acceptlng all the
facts on which this opinionis loended, 1 think a conset interpretation oi
them would ehcw that the “philosophical view ” ci wagee le that which
regards thern as “peili'’ or popello out oi capital. Profit en capitellsed
labcur or interest on credit ςινοο hy labourers ιο their employers ought
notit seem ιο me, to be regarded aa strictly wages. Oi course, capital·
ists always expect to be repaid oct ci the product oi iaboer, and are
always influenced by their expectatione as ιο the mount and velue ol the
produet ln determining the rate oi weges which they wlll consent ιο glve.
The view oi Walter ae ιο the source oi weges is not ιο be confounded with
thet ol (iserge, its exaggeratlen and cadcature. The interesses which he
drawa irem it are in no degree either revolutionary or socialistlc. Hie
