inequalities that the general level of society is
always being raised in progressive communities.
The material wealth, the intellectual acquisitione,
and the moral gains which constitute the riohes of

generous ideals.

Besides, while in every Democracy there will be
a struggle of political parties, parties will always

feel that they need organisation, and organisation
