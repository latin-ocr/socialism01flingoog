96 SOCIALISM

sooialistic have hers been iar more poweriul than individualistic
forces.

The tecching oi Christ hes been often represented aa eminane,
and even cs communistio. A well-known sccialist writer, ΜΓ. Ε.
Beliort Bar, however, often insiste on what he calls its “one-
sided, introspectivs, and individualistic character.” An impartial
examination oi it will lead, I think, to the conclusion that it was
so comprehensive and harmonicus as to bc neither individualistic
nor eccialistic. While worthily estimating the value and dignity
oi the individual soul, it kept ever in view the claime both oi
brotherhood and of the kingdom oi God.

The Mediaeval Ohumh exalted to the utmost eocial authority as
embodied in the Ohurch. The Reiormars demanded that churchly

(vol. i. pp. 202-36) will be iound a valuable study on the Indi-
vidualism oi the latter and oi Alexander Vinet, Vinet, however,
while insisting strongly on tha importunos oi individuality,
expressly disclaimed “ individualism.”

Ethical individualism has made itseli visible in egoistic
hedonism, tha sellish theory, the utilitarianism oi personal
interest. It has assumed various phasee. it was maintained
both in the Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools oi antiquity. In
later times we find it represented by Hobbes, Mandavills, Paley,
Helvetiae, Max Stirnar, dc. It makes duty identical with per-
sonal interest. It judges oi actions solely by their consequences,
and yet leaves out oi account thoir effecte on society. At the
same time, by an instructius inconsistency, the ethical Iadi-
vidualist, while resolvingvirtue into a regard to personui interest,
