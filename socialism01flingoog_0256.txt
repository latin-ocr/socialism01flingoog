THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 253

the vslue of the labour eontribution. Itis besides impraotioable.
“ If in a Demoorstio Collectivism it were to be attempted from the
outset to apportion men’s share, not aooording to their contribu-
tion of work, but according to their needs, the result would be
that shortly every portion oi the ‘sovereign peopla' would
appear to be, and would even be, in a great stete of need and
destitution. Everything would get out of hand, and s hopeless
confusion eosne, the only way out of the difficulty being ιο
declara o universal squality of need, a solution most unjust, most
wsarisome, and most eonduoive ιο idleness.’-'

8. Democratio Colleotivism undertakes to suppress all “ exploi-
tation.” It ean, however, do nothing of the kind, inasmnoh as
the real value oontributed hy labour to the produnt cannot be
determined. It would even, by suppressing all individual home-
produotion, make impossible in any osse a distribution oi the
entire produot of labour oroi its full realieed vslue. It would
thus open a far wider field for exploitetion than any hitherto
known system oi produotion. “The private ospitalist of eom'ee
oould no longer exploit the wege-laboursr, einoe all private oapilal
would be over and done with. But labourer oould very really
exploit labourer, ths administratore oould exploit those under
them, the luy eould exploit the industrious, the impudent their
more modest follow-workers, and the demagogue those who
opposed him. Under snoh a system above all others it would ιο
impossible to set any limite to this Ιι would be the very system
ιο lend itself most ireely ιο exploitation, as it would have no
means of defending itseli from praetiosi demagogy and the dis·
oouraging of the more productiva and more useiul alass oi lsbour.
With the quantitative rsokoning ol labour-time, with the setting
up oia ‘normal performanoe of work‚' with the merging oi in·
tensive and extensive measurement of labour, things might reaoh
suoh a pitoh that Marx's vampirs, ‘the Capitalist,' would show up
as a highly respectable figure compared with the Sooial Demo·
matio parasitos, hoodwinkers of the people, a majority of idlers
and sluggards. The State would be the arch-vampirs, the now
State, whose fonction it would be to provide plsssure for the
peopls and ιο fill up for eooh and all the highest measure oi
eurthly bliss.”
