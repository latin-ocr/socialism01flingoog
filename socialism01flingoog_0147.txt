144 SOCIALISM

“A use-salue, or useful article, has vaius only because human labour ln
the abstract hae been embadied or materialised in it. How, then, ie the
magnitude ol this salue ιο be measuredi Plaiuiy, by the quantity of the
valuecreating substance, the labour, contained in the article. The quau-
tity cl labour, however, is measured by its duratiou, aud labant-time ln
its turn finds its standard in weeirs, days, and honre.

‘⁴ Some pecple might think that il the value oi a commodity is deter-
mined by the quantity oi labcur spent on it, the more idle and nushlliul
the labourer, the morevaluable would his commodity be, because more time
would bs required in its productiora The labour, however, that icrms the
substance oi valae ia homogeneous human labour, expenditure oi one
uniform lahem-power. The total labour-power ol society, which is em·
bodied iu the sum total oi the values ol all commodities produced by that
society, couute here as one homogeneous mass oi human labourpower,
conposed though it be oi innumerabis individual unite. dach oi these
uuita is the same as any other, so iar es it has the character ol the average
hibunt-power ol society, and takes effect as euch3 thetis, so iar aa it
requiret ior producing a commodity no more time thanis neediul on au
average, no ruore thanis socially necessary. 'l'he labeus-time socielly
necessary is that required to produce an article under tho normal con-
ditione oi productiori, and with the average degree oi skill and intensity
prevalent at the time. The introduction oi power-looms into ltngland
probably reduced by oue-hall the labour required towears a given quantity
oi yarn into eloth. The hand-loom weavers, as a matter oi lact, continued
to require the same time aa betore3 but lor all that, the produot oi ons
hcur oi their labour represented aiter the change only hali an hour's sociai
labour, aud consequentiy teli to one-halt its tormer velue.

“We see, then, that what determines the magnitude ol the vulne ot
any article is the amount ot lnbour socially necessary, cr the labem-time
socially necessary ior its productiori. hauh individual commodity, in this
connection, is to be considered aa an average sampie oi its class. (iom-
modities, therefore, ln which equal quentitiee oi labour are embodied, or
which can be produced in the same time, have the same valae. 'ihs value
oi one commodity is ιο the velue oi any other, as the labourtims neces·
sary for the production oi the one isto that necessary ior the productiou
ui the other. As valnas, all commoditles are only definite massas oi con·
gealed labent-time.” ⁴

Tbevalidity oi what Marx thus maintains is obviously and
entirely dependent on the conclusiveness oi the argument which
we have already shown ιο be worthless. Had he made out labour
to be the sole principle, tha common and only substance, oi velue,
we could not have reasouehly refused to admit amount or quantity
