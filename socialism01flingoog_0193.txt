What return is due to labour cannot be determiaed in any such
easy, simple, definite way as Marx would have us believe.

His next step is the most extraordinary of all. Itis to treet

and illusory argument there could not be; and yet it is all that

we get at the very point where argument of the strictest and
strongest kind is most needed. ¹

The labour· which the capitalist pays for produces, according to
Marx, no profit, any more than what he calls constant capital.
Il the capitalist, therefore, received only the labour ol six hours
from each of his workmen ha would make no profit. Marx

expounds at great length hie conception of what takes place in
the conversios ol ro lbs. of cotton into yarn when tho processis
affected by means oi eir hours’ labour paid for at its natural
velue. He distinguishes and dwells on the eost ol the different
factore in the process, and assures us that in this case the
capitalist can get no more lor his cotton yarn than the total cost
ol ite productior, or, in other words, must necessarily leil ιο
create surplus-value. Yet he does not attempt ιο show us en'
what his assurance ie founded3 does not discuss the question
whether the capitalius might not even in the case supposed obtain
a profit. There is no alemant of argument in his illustration.
The hypothetical example on which he discourses so elaborately,
doubtlese clearly expresses his view3 but it does not in the
slightast degree confirm it.

The capitalist, then, according to Marx, cannot get profit either
from his constant capital or from the labour which he pays for.
But, says he quite gravely, the capitalist compris the labourer ιο
