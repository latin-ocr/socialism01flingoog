434 SOCIALISM

This view prevails among those who acoept Religion
in its proper acceptation, and who at the same time
believe, or fancy they believe, in genuine Sooialism
It is prevalent, therefore, among so-ealled Christian
Sooialists,whetheractuallySocialistsormerelypseudo-
Sooialists. The great majority of socalled Christian
Sooialists are, in my opinion, not really Sooialists.
They are simply good Christian men anxious that
society should be imbued with the spirit and ruled
by the principles of Christ, and that Christ's Chureh
and its members should faithfully discharge their
duties to society. As all good and Christian men
must do, they wish to see all men happier than
they are, oppression of the wealr by the strong and
of the poor by the rich prevented, hatred and strife
between classes ended, a better distribution and
better use of wealth attainedâ€š the ties of human
brotherhood universally felt, and righteousness
established in all the relations of li fe. And, therefore,
they are not unwilling to be called Christian Social-
ists. But real Sooialists they are not. They do not
believe that all property should be either collective
or common. They aelrnowledge the right of the
individual to rule his own life, and not to be used
or abused aa the mere instrument of Society. They
differ decidedly from real Sooialists as regards the
signification of liberty, equality, and justice.

Those who first bore the name of Christian Social-

ists in England were Christians of a type as healthy,
beautiful, and noble as God's grace working on

English natures has produced. Mamiee, Kingsley,
Ludlow, Neale, and Hughes deserve to be lovrngly
