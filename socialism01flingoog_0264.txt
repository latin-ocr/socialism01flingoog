SOCIALISM AND SOCIAL ORGANISATION 263

more things improve,” says Mr. Spencer, “the louder

become the exclamatione about their badness.”
History abounds in facts which warrent these
statements. And one of the most striking of them
isthat although the workmen of Europe never had
so much freedom and power, or received so large a
proportiones the wealth of Europe, as since the
triumph of free-trade and the introduction of ma·
chinery and the risa of the large industrial system,
yet an enormous number of them believe thet never
till then had their class been so robbed, enslaved,
and affiioted, and that never was there more need
than at present to revolutionise society, and to
reconstruct it on altogether new principles*
Iblame them not; and still less do I blame the
Power which has mede human nature so that the
more it gets the more it would have, and that

attainment rarely brings to it contentment, or
outward prosperity inward satisfaction3 for I see
that unhappiness and discontent have uses in the
education of mankind, and functione in history,

¹* Thai men with merely the educatitm oi ordinary workmen should be
able to believe their condition worse than that oi the workmen ol all
tormer generatione is, oi course, bnt little surprieinffi when men like Wm.
Mortis and Ε. Bellort Bax can gravely essert that “the whole os ectr
avoided labmwiny ἀαωα are ia c sar werec mellica aa to seed, amoq, aad
clothiw thau any but the extreme srieye os tie ccrroepocdiay elate ia tte

be regretted that none oi those who have made munione oi this kind
have attempted to prove them, although they could hardly have failed tc
perceive that ii they eueeeeded they would thereby not only make a most
valuable contributlon to historical selenae, but inflict a really fatal hlov
on the civilieation which they detest. Julius Wolff, in hie “system der
