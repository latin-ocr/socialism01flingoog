tione. But unless politioal intelligenoe, indepen-

politioal associatione may easily become the seete
of wire-pallens, edroit enough to juggle the mass
of the people out of their rights, to dietate to
Parliement what it shall do, end to subject what

to be misrepresented, deceived, end plundered in
the most shemeless end humilieting manner by its
politioel committees. It has known their chnraoter;
it hes despised them; it hes groened over their
doings3 but somehow it has not been able to deliver

more to make nearly perfect It demands intelli·
genoe, effert, sels-restraint, respect for the rights
and regnrd sor the interest of others, momlity,
patriotism, end piety in the eommunity as a whole.
