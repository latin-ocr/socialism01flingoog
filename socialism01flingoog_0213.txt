210 SOCIALISM

I do not maintain, then, that the individua}
ownership of land is an absolute or unlimitcd right.
I do not even maintein it to bc an essential or
necessary right. It is not tho only form ol property
in land which may bc just. It has been generally,

if not always, preceded by tribal or communal
ownership, and it may bs succeeded by collective or
natione] ownership. It may be limited, conditioned,
modified in various ways according to the changing
requiremcnts of time and circumstance. What Ι
hold in regard to it is simply this, that in itself, and
apart from abusos, it is not unjust, but, on the
contrary, as just as any other kind of individual
property, or even as any other kind of property,
individua] or collective.

In order to establish the legitimacy of collective , ἶ

property in land, the illegitimacy of individual
property in land is affirmcd. But the connection
between theone contention end the other is far

hom obvious On the contrary, it is difficult to see
how collective property in land can be right if

Proudhon defines property ss “le droit d'nssr et d’sbnser,” tta riqis to·
asc cod chuno, and holds that the phrase jm tetendiet chami in the
delinition ot property in the ‘¹ Pnndects ” may be so translated (scs his
⁸⁸ De ls propraetor ch. it). The interpretation is, however, undoubtedly·
