communities, the rational strength and the family tie both would
be weckened. A State so constituted would resemble, in im·
portant respects, one consisting of small brotherhcods, or ymos,

the latter when general society is as yet undeveloped.'' ⁹
Communism is, ol course, not to be conlounded with schemes
lor the equal division of property. It aims ct the abolition of
private property, notat the multiplicatiori ol private properties.
lt can thus repel the objection that it implica the necessity lor
a constantly recurring division of properties in order. to keep
them equal. It cannot escape, however, the nmssity oi imply-

some conception ol equality or equity. “common'' can only .

individuale ol a community have an equsl or proportional right.
It differs from individua] property merely in that each individuul
interested in it is not free iu dealing with it to aot according to
his own views ol what is for his advantage, but is dependent ou
the wishes and conduct ol all the other individuale composing the
community. The production oi wealth munet be otherwise
“common” than as the productiori of a number ol combined
aud cooperating individuale, each ol whom must beer his own
burden of toil. The produot of common capital and labour can
only be consnmcd or enjoyed by individuuls. There can be, in
iact, no productior, possession, or enjoyment, which is not
,ultimately individual, even under the most communistic mange·

divides itsell among the individua] members ol the society, and,
that in a way which may be as disastrous ιο them as would a
continuous equalisation of properties to the individual citizens
of a commonweelth.

Communism can only be consistent and complete when it
