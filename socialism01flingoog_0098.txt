INDIVIDUALISM 95

opportunity for deliberate and determined action 11 now always with us
and local autonomy 111 all 10011 matters will still leave thefullest outlet
101 uatioual aud internetionai 8001111101. We therefore coufideutIy appeal
to all Socialists to sink their individuai crotchets in a business-like
endeavour to realise in our own day that complete communication 01
industry ior which the economio forms are ready aud the minda of the
people are almost prepared.”

111. Iumvmusmsn—In speculative philosophy the torm Indi-
vidualism bears two acceptatione. lt has been applied tc
designabo the theory which would explain the universe by the
ageucy 01 1 multitude 01 uucreated, individuated forces or

willa. In this sense wo hear 01 the individualism 01 11111111Λ
01 Bahnseu, and others. More frequently, however, what is

meant by Individuulism in this sphera 01 thought 11 tho theory
which represents tho individual consciousness as the ultima
ground 01 111 knowledge and certitudo. In this sense one speaks
01 the Individualism 01 Descartes or Rousseau, or 01 the indi-
vidualistic character 01 the philosophy 01 the eighteenth century.
Obviously in neither 01 these censes is the term Individualism the
antithesis 01 Socialisrn. '

It is otherwise iu the spheres 01 religion, ethice, politics, and
economics. Individuulism, like Socialism, may be religione,
01111011,001111011010001101111011. And iu 111 these sphcres Indi-
vidualism is, like 80011111110111)1 partially realisable. There
can be no complete Socialism, 101 society in entirely sacrificing
the individual must annihilato itself. Thera can be uo complete
Indiuidualism, 101 the individual is inseparable from society,
lives, moves, and has his being in society. Both Individunlism
and Socialism can only exist as tendencies or approximatione to
nnattainable and selfcontradiotory ideals created by irrational
and excessivc abstraction. 01 course, the more individualistic a
man is the more Socialism will he fancy that he sees, aud tha
more socialistic he is the readier will he be to charge other men
with individualism. One who does justice to the rights both
01 the individual aud 01 society will probably conclude that
Indiuidualists are not 10 numerous as they are often represented
to bo, and that many whp call themselves Socialists do so without
much reason.

There may be Individualism as well as Socialiem in the sphere
