in hanting game which he oould buy in the market for a few
oente or dollara. And eo it ie generally. Man, ae eoon ae he
rieee above the animal stage, makee no attempt to avoid labour,
ae a trouble and a pain; he rather eeeke itae a delightful
exereiee of hie leoultiee. There ie nothing in the world eo
satisfactory ae labour for a rational end.

‘⁶ The beeeleeeneee of the two assumptione with negard to
satisfaction and labour having been shown, the third falle to the
ground of iteelf. Sinoe material wealth ie not the meane to the
higheet eatiefaetion, and labour ie not a eynonym for pain and
trouble, it follows at enee that it ie not at all true that men
eeek to obtain the largest amount of eatiefaetion with the
emalleet amount of labour. Thue, one of the meet fundamental
assumptione of the eurrent politioal eeonomy provee utterly
untenable, when applied to rational beinge. By attempting eo to
apply it, eeonomiete have been forued to bring men down to the
level of the brutae. Many of them, consequently‚ have goneto
work to prove that man, in hie eoonomie relatione at leuet, ie
governed by brute lawe, over which he hee no control, for
example, the law that every man must buy in the oheapeet
market and eell in the deareet. Aeauming eelfiehneee to be the
only motive power in politieal eeonomy, they have been fomed
to the oonelueion that man ie governed entirely by animal lawe,
and they have aeeepted the eonelusion. A puerile enough pro-

’eedure, eurely!

“In a true politieal eoonomy, suited to human hoinga, the
whole of human nature, and not merely ite lower, animal part,
muat be taken into aoeount, and wealth muet be looked upon,

·not aa at an end, but ae a meane to the building up and per-
feeting of that nature. We muet no longer ask how, given·
human nature as purely eelfieh and eertain other eonditione,
‘wealth will be produced and distributed; but how wealth muet
be produeed and distributed in order to pave thewayfor the

, perfecting of human nature in the whole hierarehy of fordione,

r, ›headed by the moral ones.”*
