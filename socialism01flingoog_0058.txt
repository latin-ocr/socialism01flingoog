COMMUNISM, COLLECTIVISM, AN D
STATE INTERVENTION.

Tan two chief forms of Socialism are Communism
and Collectivism. Both are clearly included in
Socialism, and they are easily distinguishable. It
is unnecessary to say much regarding the first.
The second is the only kind of Socialism which is
very formidable, aud, consequently, the only kind
which urgently requires to be discussed.

Communium is related to Socialism as a species to Δ
its genus. All Communists are Socialists‚ but all
Socialists are not Communists. Perhaps all Social-
ism tends to Communism. Socialism revolts
against the inequalities of condition which result
from the exercise of liberty. But why should it
stop short, or where, in opposing them, can it stop
short, of the complete equality of conditione in
which Communium consistsl Only when property
is lest undivided, when it is held and enjoyed by
the members of a society in common, is there
equality of condition.

It is often said that Communium is impracticable.
In reality it is the form of Socialism which is far the
most easily, and has been far the most frequently,
practised communistic societies have existed
