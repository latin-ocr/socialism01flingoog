SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 493

SUPPLEMENTARY Nora-THE OHURoffs GALL ΤΟ
STUDY socIAL QUESTIONS.

The following remarks oi the author on this subject have already
appeared in print. They are reprinted here because oi their close
connection with the concluding portion oi the chapter.

“ The call of the (lhurch to study socia] questions is not a new
oue, except so far in form. In substance it ia as old as the
Ohurch itself. The teaching oi Ohrist and of the Apostles'was
the setting forth oi aGospel intimately related to the society in
which it appeared, and vitally affectiug the whole future oi the
society which was to be. The Ohurch may find in the study oi
the Now Testament the same sort of guidance ior its socicl activity
asan individual minister may find in it ior the right performance
oi his pulpit or pastoral duty.

“Just es in the New Testament there are the all-comprehensive
“ aud inexhaustibly fruitful gertus of a periect doctrine of the
ministry of the Word, and of the pastoral care, so are there of a
periect doctrine of the social mission of the Ohurch. Indead, the
Sermon on the Mount alone contains far more oi light fitted to

dispel social darkness, and iar more oi the saving virtue which
society needs, than any iudividual mind can ever iully apprehend,
or than the Ohurch universal has yet apprehended.

‘⁶ Ii the call oi which I have to speak were not thus old as well
ae new; ii it were not a call inherent in the very nature of the
Gospel, and implied in the very end oi the existence of a Ohurch
on earth; if it summoned the ministare of the Word away irom
the work which Christ had assigned to them3 if it required them
to discard their diviuely-inspired text-book, it could hardly he a
true oue, and ministare might well doubt if it could be incumbent
on them to listeu to it. But itis no such call. For, although it
be one which summoue us to reflect on what is required oi ue in
the circumstances oi the present hour—one which is repeated to
us by God's providence daily in events happening arcund us and
pressing themselves on our attention-it is also one which comes
down to us through the ages from Him who lived and suffered and
died in Palestine centurias ago, in order that, as God was in Him,
and He in (lod, all men might be one in Him.
