SOCIALISM AND LABOUR 143

accept either the mere assertion oi Marx or a few irrelevant
words from “old Barbon’' inlisu ei proof. That the desir-
ability of commodities can ever be legitimately abstracted in the
determination of their values is plainly in the utmost need oi
procl, and most unlikely to receive it. Without the former, use·
velue, there would bs not sn atem oi the latter, exchangevalue,
and therefore to spealr of the “total abstraction '' of the former
in exchangeis absurd. To take no account of the degrees of
desirability oi commodities, and of the qualities and circumstances
on which they depend, and in relation to which they vary, is to
make all explanation of their values impossible. The resolution ¹
of Marx to “leave out of consideration the usevalue oi commodi·
ties‚” without any justification of the doing so, was very con·
venient but quite illegitimate.

He carries it into effect: and then he has only to draw an

filled with characterless and undifferentiated objects; with things

which have no elements or qualities, bodies or shapcs3 with “ pro-
ducts of human labour in the abstract ; '' with ‘⁶ crystals oi the
universal social substance, values.” What rubbish! What poor
dialectic jugglery ! And ctat iswhat Sooialists take ior invincible
logio.

In reality‚ notwithstanding the wave oi the prestigiatory wand‚
the world of commodities, the realm of values remeius unaffected.
Among its contente there are not merely products of labour but
also producte oi nature. Its objecta have not exclusively the one
property of having been originated by human exertion. They
are equally objecta oi human desim in vanous degressa, objecta oi
demand and supply, objects relatively rare or abundant. The
mere “ crystals ” and “ congelatione '’ of homogeneous human
labour into which Marx would resolve them, are the creatione of
an abstraction and imaginationunguided by reason and regardless

Of difficolt for the doctrine oi Marx cs to the cause or principle

oi velus. His doctrine as to the measure of velue naturally
follows from it. He states it thus:
