of life or death for them to decide whether they will
serve God or Mammon. “No man can serve two
masters: for either 110 will hate the one, and love

the other; or else he will hold to the one, and ἵ

despise the other. Ye oannot serve God and Mam-
mon.'’ These are among the truths of which the
Churoh has to remind the rich man. They are of a
kind hard enough for him to learn without being
made harder by unoharitable abuse of the rich
simply as such. If he leam them, the richer he is
the better will it be for society.

There can be no doubt that the Ohurch should do
more than she is at present doing for the solution of
social and labour problems, in the sense that she
ought to do her duty better, present the Gospcl
with greater fulness and power, push on her home-
mission work with increased zeal, give her sympathy
and (ιο-0001111011 111010 heartily to all mensures
clearly tending 10 the economio and moral advanoe·
ment of the community‚ strive more earnestly to
diffuse among all classes the spirit of Christian love
and brotherhood, of righteousness and peace, and
exemplify in herself more perfeotly the beauty of
that spirit. As I have already indicated, however,
it is not the office of the Church to furnish definite
solutions of those problems. Hence her official
representatives should be very cautious both as to
the extent and as to the temper in which they
intervene in disputes regarding them.

Especially is such caution necessary in regard to
those deplorable confliots between labour and capital
which are so prominent a feature in the present age.
