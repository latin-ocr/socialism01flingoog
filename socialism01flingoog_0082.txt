societies which compose itare lacking in personal
and moral energy; cannot, as 00 organic whole, be
vigorous and healthy 11 110 constituent cells and
component members have their strength absorbed‚
and scope for their appropriate activity denied them,
by the foolish and tyrannical meddlesomeness 01 110
head, its Government.

When we speak 01 the intervention 01 the State
what we really and necessarily mean is the inter-
vention 01 the Government through which alone the
State 0010. And every Government is under tempta·
tion to interfere both too little and too much ; both
to neglect its duties and to occupy itself with what
it ought to let alone. There are, indeed, fanatical
admirers 01 Democracy who seem 10 believe that in
democratic countries the danger of Governments
interfering too much neods not to be taken into
account3 that when the people at large elect their
governors Govemments will cesse to be encroaching
and unjust. The optimism 01 such pemeus is 01 the
shallowest conceivable kind. There 10 nothing
either in the nature or in the history 01 Democracy
10 warrant it. Democracies are always ruled by
parties3 their governors are always the leaders of
· parties3 and parties and their leaders are naturally
ambitione, selfish, and grasping; or, in other words,
prone to aggrandise themselves at the expense 01
their adversaries and of the commonwealth. Demo·
oratic Governments are, consequently, in no wise
exempt from temptatione to the intervention which

¹ unduly restricts the liberties, undermines the

independence‚ and saps the.. vigour 01 individuale
