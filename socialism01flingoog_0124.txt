SOCIALISM AND LABOUR 121

Ae under the reign of competition, however, these
evils largely exist, and ae in all our large centres of
population many of the physically. intellectually,
and morally weak or lethargic‚ and many who are
unfavourably situated‚ break utterly down, and fall
into the loathsome maes of pauperiem and crime,
which is the standing reproach and ehame of our
civilisation, society ought undoubtedly to occupy
iteelf in earneet endeavour to prevent and supprees
misery and vice. To abendon the fallen and
unfortunate to their fate, to say “let the fittest
survive,” is unchristian and inhuman; it is even
inexpedient, and sure to degrada, corrupt, and
weaken a people. Mr. Spenoer hae done grievous
· injustice to hie own theory of development in
representing it as involving such a conclusion. The
State, it seems to me, is clearly under the law of
duty in relation to the destitute and helplese. If,
indeed, their wante cun be more wisely and
efficiently relieved by individual charity or special
organisations than by ite own intervention, then, of
course, it ought not to intervene; but if this be not
the case it must act iteelf, and supplement private
charity in so far ae it is insufficient‚ taking due
care neither to deaden the germs of aelf-help nor to
dry up the sources of voluntary liberality. It ie
further its duty to watch over the institutione and
administration os private oharity lest they increase
and confirm, as they so often do, the very evile
which they are intended to diminieh and remove.

And nov, atter these elucidatione, I do not
hesitate to give my entire assent to the principle
