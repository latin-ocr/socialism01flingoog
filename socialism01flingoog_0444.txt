SOOIALISM AND RELIGION 443
than that which they nvo in ne flesh, then, buc '

only then, isit natural to conclude that their sole
concern should be to get while on earth all the
happiness which they can. A philosophy which
maintains the existence of God, the supremacy of a
Divine moral laW, the reality of an unending life,
plainly cannot forward the designs of those who aim
at the entire subjection of the individual to society
so consistently or effectively as one which affirms
that there is nothing supramaterial, nothing higber
than man himself, no life beyond the grave, no
absolute good. The adherente of Social Democracy
bave not erred in thinking that Religion with its
hopes and fears, Theology with its doctrines of the
invisible and eternal, and Spiritus] Philosophy with
its theses based on speculative and moral reason, are
serious obstacles to the realisation of their plans,
That they will come to dissociate their Socialism
from Atheism and Materialism is, in my opinion,
extremely improbable. For, although they would
thereby disarm the hostility of many who are at
present necessarily their opponente, they would
also immensely decrcase the number of those who
would cercior, or could believe in, their Socialism.
It is only on those who are without religious saith
that socialistio schemes exert a strong attractive
and motiva force. The most completely socialistic
schemes are those which are freest from the contact
and constraint of religion.ll
