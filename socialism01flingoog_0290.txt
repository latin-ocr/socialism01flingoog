interest and importanoe, is likely to be far more
agitated in the twentieth century of our era than it
has been in the nineteenth‚ to be more interwoven
with political and social questione, and to be the
source of more momentous changes in the develop-

indicating away of solving or of settling it when
they repeat such party catohwords as “ Secularise
the State? “Dissociate Politics from Religion,”
“Separate Church and State,” and the like, are
mistaken. These phrases solve nothing, settle no·
thing, and recommend what is as impossible as to
separate soul and body without producing death.
The Ohurch may contest the action of the State,
and tyrannise over its subjects all the more for
being in socalled separation from it. The Ohurch
· necessarily acts on society with such power either
for good or ill that it is of the highest importance
that it should be for good. An enlightened pure, and
earnest Church, faithful to the principles and ani·
mated by the spirit of its Founder, is not less
essential to the right organisation of society, and to
the prosperity and progress of a nation than a good
civil government. Indixiduals become through con-
nection with it far more able to benefit their fellows
and serve their country.

What have Socialists to propose reg'arding organi-
'sation in this spherel Nothing, certainly, of any
value. The main body of them cherish the expecta-

tion of the disappearance of the Ohurch. This only
shows their inability and unwillingness to look at

facts as they are. Even if a man disbslieve in the
