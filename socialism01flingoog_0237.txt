234 SOCIALISM

The majority of Oollectivists, however, do not
imagine that the State will or can purchase the
property which they desire to see transferred from
individuale to the community. They look to its
being taken without payment. The real leaders of
Ooheetivism in England-the chiefs of the Social
Democratic Federation—do not attempt to conceal
that thisis what is aimed at. They tell us quite
plainly that they are aware that it is most improb-
able that Collectivism will be established otherwise
than by revolution and force ; and at the seme time
that they are determi ned to work for its establish-
ment.

I shall say nothing as to the morality of this
resolution. And it is unnecessary to do more than
merely call attention to the short-sightedness and
folly of it. What chance could there be of benefit
resulting from it i Attempts to realise Collectivism
by force are only likely to lead some unhappy and
misguided men to outbursts of riot as contemptible
as deplorable, and from which they must be them·

selves the chief sufferers. Were such attempts to
become gravely dangerous they would discredit
democracy in the eyes of the majority of the com-
munity and cause them to throw themselves for pro-
tection into the arms of despotism. It would thus

already shown in detail, the principat characteristic oi industrini progress

ever. Socialism is still more vitciiy opposed to historical development.
since it ciuis at reversing the broadcst principle or progress, the con·
tincous substitution, hemely, oi contract for status? (⁶‘Principles oi
Polliiccl Economy,” 1893, vol. i· p· 433.)
