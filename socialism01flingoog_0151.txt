intensified, or rather, as multiplied simplelabour, a given quantity
oi skilled labour being considered equal to a mester quantity ol
simpla labour. Experienoe shows that this reductionis con·
stantly being made. A commodity may ιο ιιο product oi the
most skilled labour, but its value, by equating it ιο ιιο product oi
ample unskilled labour, represents a definite quantity oi the
latter labour alone. The different proportione in which different
sorta oi labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their standard,
are established by a sooial process that goes on behind tha backs
oi tha producers, and,oonsequently, appear to be bned bycustom.·
For simplicity's sake we shall henoeiorth account every kind of
labour ιο ιο unskilled, simle labour.”'

This is a very curicus answer. The question to which it
should ιο a response isone not about “counting ” or “ consider-
ing ” or what is “ constently being dona”; but about what is, and ⁴
what is implied in Marx's doctrine that duration of labour is the
measure of value. Our sculptor gcts ior one day’s work twenty
times as much as our hodman gets ior the same length oi labour,
and labour as intense and much less pleasant. How does this
happen il duration oi labour be the measure oi valuei “Ol”
replies Marx, “I am willing ιο reokon the sculptor’a day equal to
twenty days oi tha hodman.” But that is no answer. What
alone would be an answer would ιο ιο show us that one day oi
the sculptor really is equal in duration to twenty days oi the hod·
man. And when that is done it will be further necessary ιο
show, how, ii one day oi labour may be twenty days of labonr, or
indeed any number oi days, a day can have any definite duration,
or the labour done iu it any definite valu03 in a word, how dura·
tion oi labour can have the characters of a measure at all

Furthsr‚ Marx takes “simple average labour,” “simple un·
skilled labour,” as his bnis oi reckoning and reasoning. He
abstracte or disregards all that individualises and differentiates
men as labourere or producere. Ηο represents “ average ” as
exchanged against “ average,” one hour’s work oi one man as in
the abstract equivalsnt to one hour's work of another man, evan
although he is forced to reckon it aa sometimes equivalent to
twenty or sven mora hours’ work oi certain men. Surely this is
