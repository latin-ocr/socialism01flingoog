NATIONALISATION OF THE LAND 209
ately published on a first of April. No elaborate

reasoning is needed to convince reasonable men that
property understood as it was by Proudhon, if it
were possible, would be theft3 or that if society
allow such theft-allow rights of property in laud,
or in anything else, which are clearly auti-soeiaL
plainly injurious ιο the community—it is foelish,
and forgetful of its duty*

⁴ The argumentation 01 hir. Herbert Spencer (sae “Social Statica’l
cin ix.) against the legitimacy 01 private property proceeds, like that oi
Proudhon, very iargely on the assumption that a right to do right implica a
riphttodowrossp,· thatcsrs'phtle use 11111111ιοί11 ιί a ripis ιο abuse. hir.
Spenoer may 01 may not heve been consciens oi making this assumption.
He has certainly 11οι shown that he vas entitled to make it. When, there·
iore, he iniere that “a claim ιο private property in land involves a land-
ovvning despotism,”that ii men havesrighttomake the soil private property
“it would be proper ior the sole proprietor oi any kingdom—a Jeraey 01
Guernsey‚ ior example-to impcse just what regulatious he might choose
on its inhabitants, to tell them that they should not live 011 his property
unless they professed a certain religion, spoke s particular language, pald
him a specilied reverence, adopted an authorissd dress, and confirmed to
all other conditione he might see lit ιο 11111111,” and the like, he only
makes manifest the absurdity latent in au assumption oi his own.

It is irem “the law oi equal ireedom '⁹ that Mr. spenser deduces “the
injustioe oi private property.” Il each man ‘¹ has 1111110111 ιο do all that he
villa, provided he infringes not the eqnal ireedom oi any other, then each
oi them is free ιο use the earth ior the satisfacticn oi his vante, provided
he allows all others the same liberty. And, conversely, it is manifest that
no one may use the earth in such a vray ss to prevent the rest irom
similarly using it; seeing that to do this is ιο marne greater ireedom
than the rest, and consequently ιο break the lav.’'

111. Speneer has overlooked that “the lass 01 equal ireedom” only
coniers 111 equal right to try, but uot sn equnl right ιο succeed. It entitles
every man to try to become Prime Minister, but it does not forbid only
0111111111 becoming Prim Minister. And ae to land, not only is it not
“manifest’' but it is maniiestly ridiculous “that 110 one may use the
earth in such a way as to prevent the rest from similarly using it.’' 1t
any man uses a tield ior agricultural pmposes or 1 portion 01 ground ιο
build a 1101111 on it, he necessarily preveuts 1111 other people irem similarly
using it.

111. Spenoer, it is proper ιο add, has ceased 10 believe in either tha
