SOCIALISM ΑΝΙ) LABOUR 149

exceedingly unreal and unreaeonable. Is not all, or nearly all,
eooncmie labour simply more or lose anakim, and most ol it
that we call unskilled very iar from really sol The “ average ’'
quantity of individual labour performed in a community may be
a quantity which not one individual of the community exactly
aeeomplishes. Every man oi them may produce either more or
less than the average so that there may be no average to ex-
change. In a ςίνοιι time almost any one individual produces
more and another lese than a special average, and hence cannot
exchange on the footing of such an average without the one
suffering an unfair loss and the other gaining an uniair advan-
tage. Marx, in a word, hae rested hie theory not cn reality‚ but
on a fictitious abstraction. Hie unite of measurement and cal·
culation are arbitrary and inapplicable. His “simple average

various other pseudo-scientifie myths.

1 only require to add that the theory of Marx which has been
under review receives many contradictione from experience. As
we have seen it supplies us with no measure for the economic
appreciation of inventive mechanical genius, industrial and oom-
mereial enterpriee, or talant for business management. Nor does
it account for the velue oi specially skilled and artistic labour3
nor for the value of rare, and still less ol unique objects; nor
for the velue of natural advantages, or of the spontaneous pro-
ducte ol neture; nor for the slight value oi abnormally ill-paid
labour. But this line oi argument hasbeen so often and eo
conclusively followed up both by the critice ol Ricardo and the
critice of Rodbertus and Marx thet it may suffice merely to refer
to it.

Iret ue now pass to the account which Marx gives ol the
relation oi lahour to capital. Ae regante thie portion oi his
teaching‚ however, I shall here confine myseli to mere exposi-
tion, reserving criticism for the next supplementary note.
Marx conceives ol capital in a peculim way. It is, in his view,
not simply weelth which is applied to the productiora of wealth‚
hut wealth which is applied for the exploitation of labour.

mente οι productiora which capiteliets employ for the
exploitation and enslavemcnt of labourers.” Nona oi these
