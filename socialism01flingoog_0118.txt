imagine that they are wholly his work, and that he
is entitled to receive the whole value of them. But
in this he deceivcs himself. Hc alone has not made
the shoes; those who prepared his leather and
formed his tecla, whoever pays him a wege or lete
him his shop, or finds customers for his shoes‚ and
even the policeman, soldier, and sailor, the magis-
trate, the judge, and cabinet minister, who secure
him from disturbance, violence, and fraud in the
prosecution of his business, have all contributed to
the productiori of the shoes, and to the worth of the
shoes. It takes many more people than shoemakers
to make shoee, and still more to make good markets
for shoes. And so of all other things*

well says =-“ Unhappily, in the current language oi socialists, we too
often miss important clemente which enter into all products, material or
intellectual, but which are usually completely left aside. The flrst is the
enormous part piayed in every prodnct by the society itseli in which it is
produced, the past workcrs, thinkers, and managers, and the social organism
at present, which alone enables usto produce at all. An ocean steamship
could not be built on the Victoria Nysaea, nor could iactories be estab-
lished on the banks oi the Aruwhimi. No one in these discussions as to
‘Rights oi Iebcur’ seems to allow a penny ior government, civil popula·
tion, industriai habite, inhen'ted aptitudes‚ stored materiale, mechanical
inventione, and the thousand and one traditions of the pest and appliances
ol civil organisation, without which no complex thing could bc produced
at ali And they entirely leave out oi sight posterity. That is to say,
socialist reasoners are apt to leave out oi account society altogether.
And society—that is, the social organism in the past plus the social
organism oi the moment-ie something entirely distinct irem the par-
ticular workrnen oi a given iactory or pit, end indeed has intereets and
claime opposed to theirs. Thus society, which Socialists ought to be the
very last to forget, is the indispensable antecedent, and very largely the
creator, of every product.” (¹¹ Moral and Religlous Socialism,” p. ις, 1891.)
