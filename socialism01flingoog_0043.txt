40 SOCIALISM

Socialiem has nowhere made more remarkable
progress than in Germany. Previous to 1840 it
had scarcely any existence in that country. The
organisation of the German social democratia party
took shape under the hands of Marx and Engels in
1847. The political agitatione of 1848 were, on the
whole, favourable to it. The conflict of labour and

capital, which was at its keenest about 1860, was
still more so, and is what chiefly explains the
extraordinery success of the socialistic campaign so
*brilliantly conducted by Lassalle from 186 3 to 1865.
The Sooialism of Germany has had more skilful
leaders, and a better organisation, than Socialism
elsewhere. At present it is a power which neither
Church nor State can afford to despise. It would
seem as if every eighth voter were a Socialist. ’
Socialism is also indebted to German thinkers—

Rodbertus, Winkelblech, Marx, Lassalle, Schaffla

and others-for its elaboration into a form which
allows it to put forth with plausibility the claim to
have become scientifio‚ and which really entitles it

garamantum about penult-ies and missiamanum and authority,
which takes upon itself to mmulaoture these lewe and to epply them.
