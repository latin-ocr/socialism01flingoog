SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 405

Says J. G. Fichte: “All right of property 10
founded on the contract 01 011 with all which runs
thus: We hold allon the condition that we leave
thee what is thine. Aa soon therefore as any 000
000001 live by his labour that which is his own is
withheld from him ; the eontraot, consequently, so
far 00 heis concerned, is entirely annulled; and
from that moment he is no lo'nger under rightful
obligation to recognise any man’s property. In
order that such insecurity 01 property may not thus
be introduced through him, all must, as a matter of
right and of civil contract, give him from what
they themselves possess enough 00 which to live.
From the moment that any one is in want there
belongs to no one that portion 01 his property
which is required to save the needy one from
want, but it rightfully belongs to him who is in
want.’'*

This so-called right found an influential advocate
in Louia Blanc, and received the sanction of the
Provisional Government of Franco in 1848. A real
right, however, it is not. And the State which
acknowledges it 10 be such is unlikely to be'able to
fulfil what it undertakes. A right constituted by
mere need is one which so many may be expected
to have that all will soon be in need. Society aa at
present organised has entered into no contract,
come under no obligation, which binde it as a
matter of right to support any 01 110 members. 11
