SOCIALISM

π· »ssa {essese of the nationel income, since, say,
,χχχ 'roas heu almost wholly derived from other
coporos rhsu lund. It is not the rule but the ex-
ism-tu to aske large fortunes, either by speculating
estest. or crdtivating land. The notion that the
{murionum rue appropriating all the wealth of the
ustrou, arrd kesping the other classes of society in
pserty, can be entertained by no man of unpreju-
,hssl rrriud who is acquainted with the messos
,meso to the contrary accumulated by the recent
resarcit& of scientific economists and stetisticians.
lt has to be added thet the connection of the in·
dirirluol with societyis for the owners of land, as
fio· other persons, the source cf oedcserved decre·
recures as well as of uneorned incremento. This fact
the advocates of land-nationalisation strangely over·
lcrk, or unjustly ignore. They seem to think the
conjunctura of socicl circumstances, the inceleulable
operation of social causes, only brought gain and
wealth to the possessore of land3 whereas, iu reality,
itas often brings to them loss and poverty. Riches
sometimes flow in upon them, as upon other men,
owing to the condition and fortune of the community ;
but from the same cause their riohes as frequently
“take to themselves wings and fles away.'' If,
therefore, the State is, on the plea of justice, to
appropriate landowners’ incremeuts so far as not
individuully earued, it must also become responsible
for their decrements so far as socially produced.
For society to seize ou the socially caused increment,
yet not to restore the socially caused decrement, in
individua] incomes, would be a menifestly unjust
