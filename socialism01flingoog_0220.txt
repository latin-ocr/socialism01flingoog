NATIONALISATION OF THE LAND 217

other rents, of all prices, and of all values. There
is nothing special or peculiar in the mode of their
increase or the course of their movement which can
warrant society to treet them in an exceptional way,
and to deal with property inland differently from ’
all other property.

Easily proved as this truth is, and amply proved

although it has often been, enthusiastic advocates of

land-nationalisation, like Hemy Georgo and alfred
R. Wallace, cannot afford to acknowledge it. They
have founded their whole system on the assumption
that land alone, or almost alone, increases in value
with the increase of population and wealth‚ and
that in virtue of this law the landowners of a
country by simply raising rents can and do appro-
priate all that labour' and capital contributa to the
producticn of national wealth.

The assumption is altogether arbitrary, and un·
doubtedly contrary to fact. The man who can
believe that land is in this country the exclusively,
or even a specially, remunerativo kind of property ;
that the want of it is a necessary and chief cause
of poverty‚ and the possession of it the infal-
lible and abundant source of wealth‚ displays a
remarkable power of adhering to a prepossession in
defiance of its contradiction by experience. Is there
any kind of property which increases less in velue in
Britain than landl It is known not to havedoubled
in value during the last seventy years. It has cer-
tainly diminished in velue during the last twenty
years. There is no apparent probability of any rela-
tively great or rapid riso in its velue in the future.
