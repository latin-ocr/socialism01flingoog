According to the teaching of Social Democracy

there are no natural laws in the economic sphere,
and especially in that of the distribution of wealth,
but only laws which are the creations of human will,
made by society andimposed on itsell. But this teoch-
ing is the reverse of true, and it directly encourages
men to expect from society what it cannot give them,
and necessarily embitters them against it for not
bestowingon them what· is impossible. According to
the same teaching‚ labour is the sole cause of velue,
and the labouring classes alone are entitled to all
wealth. This is no less false, and it equally tends to
spread in a portion of the community unwarrantable
hatred against another portion, and to generate ex·
travagant expectations in connection with proposals
of the most mischievous kind„ The suppressiones
the wege-system, as reoommended by Socialism,
could not fail to destroy the chief industria] enter·
prisea of a country like Britain; the abolition of
money would paralyse its commerce. The measures
of confiscation advocated by it under the names of
expropriation, nationalisation, and collectivisation‚
would take away indispensable stimuli to exertion
and prudence‚ individuality and inventiveness, and
so end in general impoverishment and misery. The
social unrest of which Socialism is the symptom
cannot be allayed with doses of Socialism either
pure or diluted. The distinctiva economic tenete of
Socialism are fatal economic errors. But it is only

on economic truths that economic well-being can be
founded. And this applies in an even special degree
to democratic societies as being sslf-governing
