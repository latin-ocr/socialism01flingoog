the spirit of fraternity. Whenever‚ for example,
they represent the distinction between rich and
poor as equivalent in itself to one between the
privileged and the oppressed, they set the poor·
against the rich by teaching error. There is
nothing unjust in men having very unequal shares
of wealth. To prevent the freedom of choice and
conduct the exercise of which leads some to wealth

aud others to poverty would be manifestly unjust y

so long as that freedom was not immorally and
dishonestly applied. To equalise fortunes hythe
employment cf force and the suppression of liberties
would be manifestly to oppress those levelled down
and unfairly to favour those levelled up.

Besides‚when liberty is only limited by justice there
isno absolute division or distinction between rich and
poor: they do not l‘orm separate castos or even dis·
tinet “ estates.” There is, in this case, a continuous
gradation from the richest of the rich to the poorest
of the poor, and there is no inequality of rights
such as there was between the nobility and clergy
· of France and the great bullr of the French people
before the Revolution.

Socialists must likewise bear the responsibility of
having seriously violated the principle of fraternity
by habitually representing capitalists, both good
and had, as the enemies and oppressore of the
working classes. They have thus spread hatred
and eumity among those who ought to live on
terms of friendly and fraternal relationship. And
they have similarly erred by indulging in much
mischievous abuse of the shop·keeping and trading·
