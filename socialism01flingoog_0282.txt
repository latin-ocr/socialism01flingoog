SOCIALISM AND SOCIAL ORGANISATION 281

yet the most cruel,wastef1d, and deplorable‚ is the
extent to which cramming is substituted for educa-
tion in all kinds of schools from the lowest to the
highest. If we only knew and felt what educetion
really is, and recognised aright nothing to be
worthy of the name which does not train the bodily
powers, or improve temper and disposition, or evoke
and widen the social sympathies, or' awaken and
regulata imagination, or quicken and exorciso
aesthptic discernment, or deepen and elevate the
sense of reverence, or help to make conscience the
uncontested sovcraign of the human mind, we
would have immensely less of poverty, of unmanly
helplessness, of bad workmenship, of low taste, of
scandaloue luxury, of intemperance, of licentious-
ness, of dishonesty, of irreligion, and the like, to
complain of. Appropriate training to bodily deit·
ness and dexterity, to intelligence, virtue, and
religion, although obviously a prime condition of
true social organisation, and just what education
should supply, is either not given at all, cr only in
swretohedly small measure by the so-called educa·
tion‘of the present day. Of course I cannot dwell
on this subject; it would be unfair, however, not to
mention that ae regards the true nature of educa·
tion, and especially as regards the relationes true
education to art, few have spoken worthier words
or done nobler work than two socialist men of
genius—»John Ruskin and William Morris.
