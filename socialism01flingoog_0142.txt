’ 'i'he doctrino oi Marx on lebour rests on whet is generally
spoken oi as e theory oi velue but which is properly only e theory
oi velue in exchnnge or oi Q· In ettompting to establish this
theory Marx begins by distinguishing between velue in uso or
utility end velue in exchengs or simply velue, but soon concludes
thet the former must be abstracted or discurded in the economic
estimation of thinge; thet the utility oi the goede or commodities
which constitute the weelth of societies does not effect their
relativo velues ; thet lebour is the source oi eil economic velue,
the oense of eli sociel wenlth. He deserves crodit ior having
tried to prove thet such ie the cese. Vericus eminent economists
hed preceded him in uffirming that lebour produced cll, or nearly
all, velue. But none oi them hed mede en effort to prove what
they effirmed. Marx is, therefore, not without merit in connec-
tion with tho proposition in question. Hie attempt to prove it,
however, ieet once ieeble end sophistieel. The following quotation

“The utility oi c thing makes it a use-velue. But this utility is not
e thing oi air. Being limited by the physicel properties oi the oom-
modity‚ it hes no existence spurt from thet commodlty. A commodity,
suoh es iren, corn, or e dumond, is therefore, sc ier es it is e material
thing, e use-velue, something useiul. This property oi e commodlty is
independent ottho amount oi lebonr required to appropriate its nseiul
qualities. When treeting oi use-velue, we elweys essnnm to be dealing
