3‚137‚000 werhem, and in 1881, 4,535,οοο, showing an increase
in their number of about 45 per cent, while during the same
period the whole population increased from 26,855‚ooo ιο
35‚003‚000, or only about 30 per cent. A similar progressive
increase of labourers hes taken place in all countries under an
energetic capitalist and manufacturing regine. Marx himself
declares the growth of official pauperiem ιο be the indication and
measure of the increase of the industrisl reserve army. Pauper-
ism, however, hes been for nearly half a centmy steadily

in 1855-9 the paupers of England formed 47 per cent. of the
