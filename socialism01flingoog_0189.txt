appropriation of the wealth created by unpaid labeur. But
thetis not what Marx had to show in order to confirm and
justiiy his conception oi capital. What he required to prove
was that it necessarily and exclusively so grows; that the
exploitation oi labour is its essential lunrtion, end the whole
secret and source of its accumulatior. 'Phat is what he hes
not done. Hence capital, as defined by him, is rather a mythic

or metaphysica] than an historic category, originating as it does
in the imaginative or dialectic identification of the nature oi
capital with its abusa, and in the persenilioation oi it as “a
vampire.’' While admitting that the present era is a capitalist
era, we may reasonably hold that “the capitalist era’' of Marx
is, il anywhere, still in the future, awaiting, perhaps, its advent

made the admiseion he should have further allowed that money
isnot otherwise capital than any commodity may be capital.
When he affirma that “if we abstract from the material suh
stanoe oi the circulation ol commodities—that is, from the
exchange oi the various use-values-and consider only the
economic forms produced by this process of circulation, we find
its final result to be money‚” he felle again into the same emor as
when he maintained that through abstraction of the use-valnas oi
commodities we lind them to be mere congelatione or crystale oi
the eocial substance, human labour in the obstruet. In other
words, he again adopts the irrational intellectual procedure which
in the Middle Ages peopled the world ol thought with “ entities ''
