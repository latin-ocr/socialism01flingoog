SOCIALISM

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.

Oolleotivist sociatam reste on economic doctrines propcunded
by Rodbertus and Marx. By designating these doctrines ‘¹ new ''
(p. 43) I am not to be understood es attributing to them any
other novelty than that oi development and oi application.
They were mainly exaggeratione of, or inferences from, doctrines
ol earlier economiste; they were certainly not “new’' mammio
aava Neither Rodbertus nor Marx was successful in dis-
covering such truths. They were both, however, learned,
laboribus, and able studente oi econcmic science3 and, by their

of course, a good deal to Foun'er. His whole system presnpposee
the trnth ol the idea that there isa radicel class distinction, an
essential social antincmy within the present industrial regime,
between murgcoc'eic and prelstuciet, or peropto. That idea was
gradually evolved and popularised in France between 1830 and
1848 by various litteratam oi whom Leuis Blanc was the most
, influentiel.

As regards the spirit oi Marx's teaching, it was the spirit oi the

generation to which he belonged 3 the imsfflpt and revolu-
