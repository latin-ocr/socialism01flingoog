WHAT IS SOCIALISM? Ι 27

appanis ιο the egoism and sellishness oi the great majority of
individuale. In the words oi Mr. Bosanquet, “the basis oi
Socialism icas yet individualistic, the State being regarded, not
as a society organic ιο good life, but as a machine subserviant ιο
the individual’s needs qod individual.” But, it may be said, does
that ιιοι ol itseli justily the employmeut of the term to signify
the true theory of societyl It seems ιο me that it does not, and
for two reasons: first, beccum it is not in itself desirable ιο
designate the true theory of society an ian ,· and second, because
those who maintain an erroneous theory oi society are in actual
possession ol the name Socielists, and will ιιοι forego their right
ιο retain it. Therelore,I thinlr, we ought to restrict the term
Socialism as much as we can ιο their creed. That the termis
already far too widely and raguely used needs no other proci
than the number oi men recognised as eminently wiso who heve
boen beiooled by it to such au extent as ιο tell us that “ we are
all Socialists now.”

The following delinitione may be added :-“ We call Socialism
every doctrine which affirma thet it ie the office ol the State ιο
correct the inequality ol wealth which existe among men, and to

reestablish hy law equilibrium, hy taking from those who have
too much in order ιο give tothose who havenot enough, aud that
in a permanent manner, and not in such end such a particular
case, a famine, ior instance, or a public catastrophe, dc.'' (P.
J anet, “ Les Origines du Socialisme Contemporain,” p. 67).-“ In
the first place, every Socialistic doctrine aims at introducing

greater equality into social conditione ; and secondly, it tries
ιο realise these reforma by tho action oi the law or the saw
(Ε. Iaveleye, “ Socialism oi Today,” p. xv.).—“ The word
Socialism has but one signification: it denotes a doctrine which
demands the suppression oi the proletariat and the complete
remissiori oi wealth aud power into the hands of the com·
munity (wllcctioitill' (T. De Wyzewa, “Le Mouvement So·
cialiste,” p. 111.)-“ Socialism is the economic philosophy of the
suffering classes.” (Η. v. Scheel in “ Schtnhergs Handb. der pol.
Oelrouomie,” Bd. i. 107.)
