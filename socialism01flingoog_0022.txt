WHAT IS SOCIALISM? 19

of society must include the truth, while exoluding
the error, both of Individualism and of Socialism. It
must be a doctrine which, while fully recognising
all the just claims os society, fully acknowledges

also all the rights of the individuale composing
society. The Socialist, of course, supposes his
Socialism to be just such a doctrine, and he may
claim or attempt so to define it. But obviously the
most extreme Individualist must believe the same
of his Individualism, and has as good a right to
detine it as if it were the whole doctrine, and the
only true doctrine, of society. The Individualist no
more wishes to destroy society than the Socialist to
suppress liberty: they agree in desiring to be just
both to society and the individual. But notwith-
standing this agreement, they differ3 and when we
scel< to distinguish them, and to define their systema
it is not with the mere general purpose or aim which
they share in common, but with the specific charac-
teristic in regard to which they differ, that we are
concerned. Now, wherein they differ is, that the
Socialist, while he may not mean to rob the inÎ‡
dividual of any portion of his rightful liberty, insists
on assigning to society powers incompatible with
due individual liberty3 and that the Individualist,
while he may be anxious that society should be
organised in the way most advantageous to all,
deems individuals entitled to a freedom which would
dissolve and destroy society. Neither Socialism nor
Individualism can, with any propriety, be accepted
as the true form of sooial organisation, or its doctrine
identified with Sociology or the scicuoe of society.
