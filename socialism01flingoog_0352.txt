SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 351

to the due subordination of what is ordinarily
called wealth to morality.*

It is also specially among Socialists that we find
the delusion prevailing that the kingdom of heaven
may be established ou earth by merely reorganising
the means and methods of the production and dis-
tribution of weelth; that man is the creature of

⁵ The vlews on Economics propouuded by hir. Buskin in “Unto this
¹Inst '’ and other wrltings ere all supposed by him to be dependent on his
definition ο1 wealth as “ the possession oi the velueble by the valiaut‚'' end
on the thesis that “there is no werdt bret lise, ilie including all the powers
ο1 love, ο1 joy¹ snd ol admiration.'' Whether they ure in reality logicaliy
derivabis irom them may well be questloned‚ but they ere eennnly quite
es vagus es 11 they were. The most definite and distinctiva oi themis
thet all lsbour ought to be pald hyan invarieble standard, good and hed
workmen elika, 11 the latter are employed ut all. “The natural end right
system respectlngsll lebonr is thet it should be pald at a dxed rste, but
the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The
false, unmtumi end destructive system is¹ when the bed workman is
allowed ιο oder his work at heli-price, sud either take the place oi the
pood, or force him by his competition ιο work ior en inadequste snm. So
iar es you employ it at all, bad work should be paid uo less than good work ς
as a bed olergymen takes his tithan, a bed physiclsu his ise, and a bed
lawyer his costs; this 1 say partly because the best work neverwes nor ever
will be done ior money at all, but chiefly because the moment the people
know they heve to pay the bed and good alike. they will try to disoern the
one irem the other, and not use the bad. Δ segericus writer in lvo

but would seriously recommend thern, ior the soribblsr's sake, es well es
their own, not to employ him!

How ls it that a man ο1 ιο much genius ss hir. Ruskin could regerd
such a methed ol reeompensing labour ss “the natural and right system '¹
when it is so obviously unnatural and so manifestly unjnst? Plalnly
because his standandei judgmeut is neither the lsws oi nature nor ο1
justice but a private ‘⁸ ldesl‚” a personui preconoeption. To count unequsls
as equal is unnatursl. Το pay ior bad work ss much es ior good is uniret.
'I'o seinse to employ “bed” ie, interior workmen, at eil is au excessively
aristocratic as well as arbitrary rule; and would not only bear hard on
the “common scribbler‚” but reduce to beggery common workmen ο1 ali
kinds.
