Unfcrtunalely Marx fcrgot that such a law, and the
statements which he mcde in support of it, could only be
established by statistics 111 11 11111111 1111111111 of relevant
11111, 111 by mere general ressoning and desertina. The only
statistioal data, however, which he submits to us—those 11 111
note 11 p. 544 (Engl. tr.)-are ludicrously irrelevant and
insufficient. ·Out oi the census reperte of 1851 and 1861 he
selected lourteen industries which shewed either a decresse cr

1 diminution of labourers in some departments of industry, but
that there had been a general 111 growing diminution oi
industrial labourers. He was bound 11 establish the prevalence
oi 1 law ; the operation ol an essential and inevitable tendency.
Manifestly his stetistics do nothing ci the lrind.

dogmatis ratiocinatior. It consiste in inserting what the facts
must be 11 111 assumption that capitalistio accumulatior is the
process of exploitation which it has been described by Marx as

being; silently taking for granted that the facts are what they ·

heve been iniermd to be; 111 loudly asserting that what was

not what we are selred to believe them 1111. They plainly
