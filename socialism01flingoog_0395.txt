394 SOCIALISM

between peoples; for the emphasis and outspoken-
ness with which they heve condemned the wars
which originate in personel ambition, in the pride
or selfishness of dynasties, and in the vanity or
envy, the blind prejudices or unreasoning eversione
of nations. They have certainly no sympathy with
J ingoism.

Yet on the whole Socialism does not tend to give
to the world peace. It is far indeed from being really
rooted as some have pretended in the love of man es
man. The fraternity which it proclaims is narrow,
sectional, and sels-contradictory. Such love as it
cen be honestly credited with possessing is very
inferior to the pure, unselfish, all-embracing affection
enjoined by Christ end eulogised by St. Paul. It is a
class feeling, partiel in its scope, mixed in its nature,
half love and half hate, genereus and noble in some
of its elements but envious and mean in others*

Hence while Socielism denounces the wars for
which Governments ere responsible, it at the same

time inflemes passione, favours modes of thought,
end excites to courses of conduct likely to give
rise to wars even more terrible and fratricidel.

⁴ The defectiveness ol the socialistic conception ol fraternlty is by no
means visible only in bed feelings end bed actions towards those who ere
not manuel labourers. Itis likewlse very strikingly exhibited by the
extent to which Sociellsm belles its professione ol sympathy even with the
operetlve classes. Socinlistic legislation end socialistic interventlon in
regmd to labour heve been lergely characterised by injustlce and cruelty
to the classes ot workers most in need ol fair treatment and generem sid ;
hrgety ln favour of the strong and to the injury of the wouh-expatriated
foreigners, non-unionists, and women. This aspect ol Sociehsm, especially
seit has mmilested itself ln France, has been effectively dealt with by
hl. Yves Guyot ln ‘¹ Le Tyrannie Soolellste,” 1893.
