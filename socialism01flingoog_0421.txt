420 SOCIALISM

mandcd in society as actually constituted; all that
would he made out is that it is a duty to endeavour
so to reconstitute society that there will be no
warrant for such abstractions, and that the claims of
perfect or ideal justice in regard to the remuneration
os labour should be satislied. Until‚ however, the
revolution effecting such reconstruction has been
accomplished in a just way the rights inseparablc
from the actual constitution of society cannot justly
be disregarded.

I do not admit, of course, that Socialists have
shown that there is any ethical necessity for such a
reconstitution of society as would secure to labour
alone all that is produced. In previous chapters (iv.-
vii.) I have argued to the contrary, and endeavoured
to point out the futility of their reasons sor repre-
senting private property in land and capital, rent,
interest, and profits as essentially unjust.

Nor do I grant that even were society organised
on collectivist principles labour would or could be
put in possession of the whole produce. There must
still bs abstractions therefrom of the same nature aa
those which are now made, although they might,
perhaps, be called by different names. That they
would bs less in proportion to the whole produce
than at present is very doubtful.

There has never yet been delineated an ideal of

society which would, if realised, secure to labour all .
that Socialists promise it. The ideal of Social
Democracy could, it is obvious, only be carried out
by a system of officialism not likely to be less expen-
sive and burdensome than landlordism or capitalism.
