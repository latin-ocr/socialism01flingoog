only mean politica] anarchy. Equality in property,
. similarly conceived ol, necessarily implies commu-
nism, and a communiam as inconsistent with even
the nationalisation of property as with its indi-
vidual appropriation; in equivalent terma, it is
destructive of the very nation and incompatible
with the very existence of property. Religious
equality viewed as a separate and independeut
right must signify that for the State there is no
difference between religion and irreligion, Chris·
tianity and Atheism; that for the State religion
has no interest, no being. All such equalities when
presented as additional to civil equality, the equality
of all men before the law, the equal right of all men
to justice, are illusory and pernicieus; they have
worth and saeredness only as included in it.

The arbitrary exclusion, indeed, of any class of
the community from political activity is a wrong to
that class. For every exclusion adequate reasons
ought to be producible, and the sooner the need for
it can be done away with the better. As regards
the suffrage uo reason either of expediency or of
principle can now be consistently urged in this
country against extending it to the utmost, as it
has already been granted even to illiteratos. Rightly
or wrongly, we have already gone so far as to have
left oursclves hardly any real or even plausible
reason for refusing any serious claim to its farther
extension, its virtual universalisation. Resistance
to any such claim can only be based on invidious
grounds, and can have no other effect than to cause
a very natural irritatior.
