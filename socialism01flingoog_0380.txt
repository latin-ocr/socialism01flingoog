SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 379

tion than the moral renovationes individuale—the
atotoaoio of John the Baptist and the precepte of

the Sermon on the Mount. The great bulk of human

misery is due not to social arrangements but to
persona] vices. It is unjust to lay the blame of the
sufferings caused by indolence, improvidence, drunk·
enness, licentiousness, and the like, chiefly on the
faulty arrangements of society, instead of on the evil
dispositione of those who exemplify these qualities
or habite. Society may not be indireotly or wholly
guiltless in the matter3 but those who are directly
and mainly guilty are, in general, the individuale
who involve themselves and others in misery through
shirking duty and yielding to base seductione. The
socialistic tecching which studiously rehains from
offending the lazy loafer, “the wicked and slothful
servant,'' the d1unkard whose sels-indulgence is the

a man, ilud the whole world, including other persons, to be only an occe·
sion end opportunity oi seli-iulflimcnt; and on these it hae to seiae it it

helpe us to maline the whole. But we have to beware ot the tyranny oi
phrases. . . The ligo doee not exiet ior what is called the ‘objectiva

sense, would reducenti individuale to slavery, end all personal ethice to
elavish obedience to existing law.'’-S. Β. Lauda ¹⁸ lithica,” pp. 209-12.
