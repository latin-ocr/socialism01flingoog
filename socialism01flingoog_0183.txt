180 SOCIALISM

therefore, a man specially apt to become possessed
by the demon of avarica, enslaved by the desire of
gain, hard and selfish, heedless of the claims of
justice and sympathy. It is only too possible that
workmen may have very real and serious grievances
against their capitalist employers. Wherever
labourers have been ignorant. politically feeble and
settered, divided or isolated—wherever they have
not learned to combine, or been so circumstanced
that they could not combine their forces aud give
an effective expression to their wishes-capitalists
have taken full advantage of their inexperience, their
weakness, and their disunion. Nowhere would it be
safe for working men to trust merely to the justice
of capitalists. Everywhere it would be ridiculous
for them to trust to their generosity. For labour
to be on its guard against the selfishness of capital,
for labour to organise itself for sels-defence and the
attainment of its due, is only ordinary prudence.
Then,while it is very easy to show against Socialism
the legitimacy of expecting profit from capital, of
claiming a rent for land, or of taking interest for the
loen of money; it is impossible to defend many of
the practices prevalent in the industrial, commercial,
and financial world. The mendacious puffery of
wares the dishonest adulteration of goods, the
mean tricks of trade, the commercial devices for
the spoliation of the inexperienced and unwary, so
prevalent among us, are, of course, discreditable
to our present civilisation. We have become so
accustomed to them that wc do not feel their
hatefulness as we ought. Socialism is beneficia]
