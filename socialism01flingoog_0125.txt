122 SOCIALISM

of industria] competition, and to reject the antago-
nistic principle of Socialism as altogether erroneous
and pernicious. What really is the principle of
industrial competition assailedl Nothing less, but
also nothing more, than the principle of industriel
liberty; than the affirmation of a man’s right to
labour, and to live by his labour, as he judges to be

· best and most expedient, so long as he does not

thereby wrong and injure his follow-men. What·
ever Socialists may say to the contrary, the
principle of competition, or laisserfoire‚ has never
been otherwise understood by economists; and thus
understood, it is simply identical with liberty in
the sphere of economics, and one form of that
liberty which makes man e moral personality.

Is it, then, unchristianl If it be, so much the
worse for Christianity. Any religion which denies
man to be thus far free must be itself so far false. Is
the principle immorall On the contrary, it is the
recognition of a moral right, the affirmation that
man is a free moral being or law unto himself in
regard to his own labour. Is it unjustl No,
because it is limited by justice. Is it a warrant for
selfishness, for unneighbourly or unbrotherly deal·
ing, for disregarding the interest of the eommunity
at large? It may seem so at the first glauce, and
socialist writers continually assume that it must be
so. But this view is most superficial, as Bishop
Butler conclusively showed long ago.

Competition, es the term is used in economics,
implies sels-love, a regard to one's own interest3
altruism is not the immediate source of any merely
