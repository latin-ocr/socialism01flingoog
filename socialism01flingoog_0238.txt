THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 235

destroy democracy without establishing Socialism.
To those who would attempt to reach Collect-
ivism through revolution these words of J. S. Mills
are exactly applicable: “It must be acknowledged
that those who would play this gamo on the strength
of their own private opinion unconfirmed as yet by
any experimental verification-who would foroibly
deprive all who have now a comfortable physical

existence of their only present means of preserving
it, and would brave the frightful bloodshed and

misery that would ensue if the attempt was resisted
-must have a serene confidence in their own
wisdom, on the one hand, and a recklessness of other
people’s sufferings on the other, which Robsspierre
and saint-Just, hitherto the typical instances of these
united attributes, scarcely came up to.”

Suppose, however, Collectivism to be established.
Is it probable that it could be maintained l Is it a
kind of system which would be likely to endurel
No. Its entire character precludes our reasonably
entertaining the hope. Collectivists have as false a
notion of what social organisation is, or ought to be,
as had their socialist predecessore, Saint-Simon,
Fourier, Owen, and so many others. They conceive
of it not as natural, organic, and free, but as arti-
ficial, mechanical‚ and compulsory. They would
manipulate and mould society from without into
conformity with an ideal of their own imaginatione,
but to the disregard of its inherent forces and laws,
the constitutional tendencies and properties of

human nature.
All notions of this kind are foolish; all efforts
