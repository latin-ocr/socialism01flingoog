WHAT IS SOCIALISM? 21

mean to employ the term Socialism, will not, I am
aware, commend itself to those who call themselves
Socialists. I do not ask or expect any Socialist who
may read this and the following chapter to assentto

the view or definition of Socialism which I have here
given. l ask and expect him merely to note in what
sense I purpose using the word, namely, to denote
only social doctrines, or proposals which I think I
may safely undertake to prove require such a
sacrifice of the individual to society as society is not
entitled to exact. I claim the right to define
Socialism frankly and avowedly from my own point
of view-the non-socialistic.

But I fully admit that there is a duty correÎ‡
sponding to the right. It is the duty of not
attempting to reason from my definition as if it
were en absolute truth, or as if it were one to
which Socialists assent. Such a definition is merely
an affirmation which the opponent of Socialism must
undertake to show holds good of any system which
he condemns as Socialism, and which an advocate of
Socialism must undertake to show does not hold
good of the system which he himself recommends.

Any one not a Socialist must, as I heve said, define
Socialism in a way which will imply that it neces-
sarily involves injustice to individuale. The Socialist
will be apt to say that in doing so one starts with
the assumption that Socialism is false and wrong, in
order, by means of the assumption, to condemn it
as such. And tha charge will be justified if one
really judges of the character of any so-called
socialistic system by his definitior of Socialism.
