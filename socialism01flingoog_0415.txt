414 SOCIALISM

istic system would naturally evolve and establish
itself from acceptanoe of the right to labour, con-
temporary Socialism has shown little zeal to get the
right affirmed and guaranteed by law, This may
on first thoughts seem strange; but Socialists have
had considerable reason for their reticente and sslf-
restraint in this respect. To recognise the right in
the existing economic order would in all lilrelihood
speedily result in such serious troubles as would dis-
credit those who were responsible for· the step and
cause a reaction from Socialism. Doing so proved
fatal to the French Republio of 1848. Even Victor
considerant and Louis Blanc acknowledged this,
although they contended, and perhaps justly, that
the workmen of Paris left the Provisional Govern-
ment no option in the matter. The events of that
period form apage of history bearing on the right
to labour not easy either to forget or misiuterpret;

and they go far to explain why since 1848 the right
in question has been so little insisted on by the
advocates of Socialism.*

Apparently Socialists have, in general, corneto
see that the right to labour wnnot he made effec-
tive in the capitalist era. Possibly those of thern
who have reflected on the subject may have felt
