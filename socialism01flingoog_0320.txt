SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY 319

put in the way of any class of persons either as to
its purchase or sale. This admission, however, is
far from equivalent to the affirmation of that
equality of right as to property which would
logically prevent the profitable use of it by any one.
There is no right to equal participatior in property,
but only a right not to be inequitably prevented
from participa-tion in it. The State is consequently
not entitled to enforce or aim etan equal distribu-
tion of property. Its function is to do justice,
neither more nor less; and the sphere of justice as to
property is merely that of equal freedom to acquire
and to use it.

The State may err and do unjustly by favouring
one class of religious opinions and discouraging
another. In the name of Christianity it may act
in a very unchristian way towards atheists and
other non-christiane. lt is bound to respect the
conscientious convictione of the least of associatione
and of every single individual. It may provide
that no man shall be excluded from Parliament
because of atheism or disbelief in Christianity‚ and
yet hold that it thereby only shows a just, a
generous, and a Christian spirit. Nothing in what
hae just been said implies that for the State
religion and irreligion‚ Christianity and atheism,
areequa13 or is even inconsistent with maintaining
that for the State no difference, no distinction, is
more profound and vital than that between religion
and irreligi0n3 that the distinction between virtue
and vice is not more so; that the distinction
between knowledge and ignorance is not so much
