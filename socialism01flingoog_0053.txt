'ibe following soeislistic periodicels are in circuistion et the

The Labour Elector, The Labour Prophe, The Leboer leode, daed

heriaco-all monthly publicatione.

Jastioe is the oldest orgen ol pure Socislism in the United
Kingdom, end at present the only orgen ol the Social Demo-
cratic Federation. It may fairly elsim to have ‘⁴ ior the past ten
years fearlesslysnd honestlyadvoosted theceuseof Sooislism.’' It
hes avoided every kind ol compromising conoessi0n‚ and rather
repelled than sought pertiel sympathisers. The number of sub-

perhaps, be about the clearest indication procurable es ιο the
extent of the belief in Socialism pure end simple. It is admitted
thet the number has never been large. H. M. Hyndman, H.
'Quelch, Ε. Bellort Bex, W. Uttley, snd S. Stepniek ere among
its ohiel contributors.

contente areola somevhat miscellaneous nature. Its principles

business purposes. Its chief merit is the amount of informetion
which it gives regerding Continentel Socialism. Ol its oon·
tributore msy be named Eleanor and Ed. Marx-Aveling, H.

show reading end reflection‚ but no praise can be honestly given
ιο threefourths ol the contente of each number. Until I saw
this publication I believed it impossible thet Socialists‚men profess·
