Whetever merits they may assign to their philo-
sophical, religious‚ end ethical theories, they hold
them to have only a secondary and supplementary
place in the socialist enred, and grant that it is not

no verdict on the character of Socialism to be
relevant and decisivo which has failed to recognise
that its answers to economie problems, its proposals
for the organisation of industry and the adminis-

Thus far they are, I think, perfectly right; and,
therefore, I shall in the present work confine myself

the truth or salsity of the socialist system, and which
is concerned with questions of the widest range of
interest. What- Socialism 'reaches on the subject
