continuity, through generations and centuries. But
manifestly should a day ever come when the direc-
torate or the State undertook to grant to all the
non-capitalists in the nation equal rights to the
stock and profits of the fund as to the capitalists‚
this measure of expropriation‚ collectivisation, or
spoliation‚ must be a revolutionary measure involv-
ing a breach of continuity‚ a rupture of social tissue,
unprecedented in the history of mankind. Redical
or revolutionery Socialists are right in maintaining
that Collectivism cannot be established by evolution.
Evolutionary Socialists conclusively argue that sociel
organisation cannot be satisfactorily or successfully
affected by revolution.

The true organisation of society must not only be
a gradual evolution‚ but must be due mainly to the
exercise of liberty, not to the action of authority.
It must be originated and carried on chiefly from
within, not from without. It must be to a far
greater extent the combined and collective work of
the moral personalities who compose a nation than
of the officials who compose its Government. There
can be no good government of a community the
members of which are not already accustomed to
govern themselves aright. The healing of society
to be effective must proceed on the whole from the ·
centre outwards.

Socielism has never seen this clearly or ecknow-
ledged it fully. From its very nature it cannot do
so, for it undervalues the individual. It leads men
to expect extravagant results from merely repairing
or reconstructing the outward mechaniam of society.
