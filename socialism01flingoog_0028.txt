WHAT IS SOClALlSM? 25

according to the definitione given, for describing that man 01
that theory as sooialistic than as individualistic, or 0011111-
vidualistio then as socialietic‚ and if you either describe thom
as both, or epply the terms to them indiscriminately‚ the words
8001011001 and Indiuidualism cease to have any distinctiva mean·
ing. It is only when in theory or in life the emphasising 01 the
social forcesis carried 10 excees relatively to the individual
energias, or 0100 wad, that either Socialism or Individualism
emerges. But 11 00, Dr. Barry should define them just as I do,
and recognise as 01 the very essenos of both a departure from
truth, a disregard 01 01101 0111 proportion.

Bishop Westoott‚ in 0 paper read at the Ghuroh Congress‚
Hull‚ Oct. ret, 1890,· treated of Socialism in a wey which justly
attracted much attention. He identified Socialism with an
ideal of life very elevated and true, end recommended that
ideal in words of great power and beauty. Ι 0011 cordially
admire his noble pleading for a grand ideal. Iam only unable
to perceive that the term Socielism should be identified with that
ideal. He says: “The term Socialism 1100 been discredited by
its connection with many extravagant and revolutionary schemen,
but it is 0 term which needs to be claimed for nobler uses. It has
110 necessary affinity with any forms 01 violence, or confiscation,
01 class selfishness, or finanoial arrangement. Ι shall therefore
venture to employ it apert from its historioal associatione as ¹
describing a theory 01 life, and 1101 only a theory 01 economics.
In this sense Socialism is the opposite 01 Individualism, and it is χ
by contrest with individualism that the true character 01 8001011010 'y
can beet he discerned. Indiuidualism and Socialism correspond
with opposite views 01 humenity. Individualism regards humanity 2
as made up of disconnected or waning atoms; Socialism regards
it as 011 organio whole, a vital unity formed by the combination
01 contributory members mutually interdependent. It follows ,
that 8001011001 differs from Individualism both in method and in
aim. The method 01 800ίο110111 10 cooperation, the method 01 ’
Individualism iscompetition. The one regards man as working
with man 101 a common end, the other regards man as working
