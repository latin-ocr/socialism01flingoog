54 SOCIALISM

Socieliem does not appeer to be flourishing in Scotlend. There
are, however, eoohlist societies in Edinburgh‚ Glaagow, Aberdeen‚
and Duudee. In Ireland Socinliam hae hndly yet mede iteeli
felt. Tbie ie, oi course, beonnae in Irelend only the Laud Queetion
hes been oi late egiteted. When the labour Question emergee
Socielism will appear, probably in a very bed form.

Britieh Socieliem hae en extraordinary number oi officere
relatively to privates. Many oi them ere able, end rome oi them
are distinguished men; but no general or commender, no mun
ol great orguuieing end guiding genius han yet appeared among
them.

The beet account ol the development oi Socinlism in thie
country ie Sidney Webb's ‘⁶ Socinlism in Englend,'' 1890. Mr.
Webb is a prominent member ol the Febien Society!
