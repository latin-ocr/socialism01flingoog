NATIONALISATION OF THE LAND 215

or general social causes and “ conjunctures,” should
of right return to society. But here, again, itis
overlooked that what is alleged is not more true of
land than of other things; that all prices are as
dependent as rents ol land on the general labour
and prosperityof the community: that if land in the
centra of London rents high, it is because houses
there rent high; and that if houses there rent high,
it is because a vast amount of business is done in
