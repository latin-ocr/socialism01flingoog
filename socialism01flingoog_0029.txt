26 SOCIALISM

against man lor private gain. The aim oi Socinlism is the fulfil·
ment ci service, the aim of Indiuidualism is the attainment of
some personnl advantage, richee‚ or place, or ieme. Socialism
seeks such an organisation ol life as shall secure for every one the
most complete development ol his powers. Individualiem seem
primarily the satisfaction cl the particular wants cl each one in
the hope that the pureuit of private interest will in the end
secure public wallare '' (“ Socialiem‚” pp. 3-4).

Now, it seems ιο me that ιο dissociate the term Socialism from Ι

the forme in which Socialiem has manileetcd itsell in history,
and to claim it for nobler uses than tc express what is distinctiva
ol them, istoc generose. What we really need the term lor is
to designate a species cl actual schemes; end to detine it aright
we must understand by it what is characteristic ol all schemae oi
that species. Il nothing but good be admitted into the definition
ol the term, while the chief or only historical schemas which have
an unquestioued right to the neme are essentially evil, these
echemee must derive from the neme and ite definition acredit and
advantage to which they are not entitlcd. And ii wc arathus
genereus to Socialism we must be less than just to Individualism.
(lonceiving ol it as the opposita ol a system wholly good, we
must rcgard it aa a system wholly evil. An Individnelism which
views individuale ae entirely unconnected and independent‚which
excludes cooperation, which deame the good ol one as important
as the good cf many or all, isone which I cannot find to have
existed. A Socialiem which really regards humanity as en
organis whole will also be difficult to discover. In ite two
great forms of Communiem and Oollectivism, Sccialiem is ol all
economic and political eystems the cue which most manileetly
treats humanity aa merely a mass or sum ol individuale. The
‘⁸ society '¹ to which it sacrifices individuale is just the majority
ol individuale. What it aime at is not the realieation ol that true
ideal ol society which Bishop Weetcott calle Socialism; it is not
the attainment ol the highest good ol the whole and ol every oue
in relation to the whole, but the attainment oi the equnl good
of all, however much sacrifice of the exceptional end higher good
ol any may be required for that purpose. Socialism as an
historical reality demands the equality of individuale in regard

tc means, opportunities, labour, and enjoyment. lt directly
