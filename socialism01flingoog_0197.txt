his economio law ol vnlne works thus: ros. ψ 2⁸.÷ ys.oost=15r. vnlne;
while ωε. 4 4⁸. ÷ 32. oost = 3oe. vulne. In other words, 152.=15r.,but
27³. = 30⁸. Now. by what sppllostion ol his own lew ol vulne, nooording
to whloh 15⁸. ooet oen only produce 15⁸. velue, oen be mnks 27⁸. eost

To essum thet, while e oost oi 15³. oennot yield n velue ot more than

loglo end the rnles oierlthmet103 end this seli-contradiction destroys
the whole basis ol hls theory. Manifestly surplus velue was no more
oreeted in the prodnotlon of the 20 lbs. of ynrn then that ol ro lbs The
3⁸. here pereded ss snrplns velue is s pure invention oi Marx. l'rne,
‘the trlok hes st lest rnooesded5' bnt it was performed by Marx, end
not by the onpltelist. lt is obviously s triolr ol metaphysles‚ end not ol
eoonomios. The only exploltntion here rerenled lsthe exploltetlon of
sooinlistio eredulity, end not ol eoonomlo labem-power.” *

We moy now eonsider ourselves entitled to rejectio toto thnt
portion oi the teeohing oi Marx in ‘⁴ Oepitnl,” which olaims to be
theory or soienoe. It iulfils none oi its promises, justifies none
oi its protensione, end is, indeed, regarded from a seientifio point

oi view, the greatest ieilure which oen be found in the whole Ἴ

history of soonomios. No men withan intelleot so vigorous, end
who hed reed end thought so muoh on eeonomie subjecte, bne
erred so eompletely, so extmvngnntly, se to the fundamental
principles end lnws oi eeononrio soienoe. The only disoovery
whioh he hes mede is thet oi “e mnre's nest.'' His pretended
demonstretion is not n logieel ohnin of established truths, but e

And the oense olbis ieilureis obvious. Pession is e bed
oounsellor. And the soul oi Merx wes filled with pessi0n3 with
per-ty hoto; with personnl animositiee 3 with revolutionnry embi-
tion. His interest in eeonomios was neither thet oi the soientist
nor oi the philnnthmpist, but of the politioel and sooisl egitst0r;
end he put forth his strength entirely in menipuhting it into an
instrument oi agitation. Thot wns the chief souroe oi such
snooess es he obtained. There wos wide disoontent. He immed
