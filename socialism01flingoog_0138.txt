and every one ean rule, or in which all ruling would
be mere idle pleasure and satisfaction. In the
existing order of society the mass of officials who
make up the administration, both oentral and local,
although they have the great advantages of im·

mediate and uninterrupted sels-supporting labour,
have it at the prioe of very striet obedienee towards
often the most insignifioant and spiteful nominees
of favoritism, and in the face of very great uneer·
tainty as to impartial and fair advaneement on the
ladder of promotion. The freedom of the individual¹
would lose in a degree which democraey would by.
no means tolerate. Popular government very
easily degeneratos into mob-rule, and this is always
more favourable to the common and the insignifi-
eant than to the noble and distinguished. Hence
Democratio Collectivism itself would be likely to
wound in a high degree the most sensitiva sels-
respect, without leaving as much freedom as does
, the present system of private service, in the ohoioe
of employment and employer, or of a plaoe of abode,
Its only equality would be that no one was in any
wiee independens, but all slaves of the majority,
and on this point again Democratio Collectivism
would eome to grief, and utterly fail to keep the
promises it makes to the better class of working

men whose sels-respect is injured by the existing
state of things.''*
