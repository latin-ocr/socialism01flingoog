Lat us see. I know of no sadder and more humiliating reflection
upon the position of lobour in our time end country, no clearsr
proof of the moral degradation entailed by our present econcmic
system, than the prevalent conviction that labour is pain and
trouble. ⁴ We hear a great deal doclsimed about the honourable·
nese of labour, as if that were a fine, nevv sentiment, instead of
being something which it is a disgrace ever to have doubted;

animal or inhumen conditione. In all natural labour, men

enjcy the pursuit of the result more than the result itself; for
