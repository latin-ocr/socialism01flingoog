We may now see how hopeless must be the attempt of Marx
to prove that the prolits of the capitelist cro derived entirely
from the robbery di the labourer. Every principle which he laid
down with a view to proving it has been found to be false. Every
proposition lrom which he would deduce the conclusion at which
he desires to arrivs hae been shown to be contrary to reason and
to fect.

Let us look, however, at such argumentation as he favours us
with. The capitalist, we are first told, cannot find profit else-
where thnn in labem-power, because labem-power has the peculiar
qunlity oi being the sole source oi value. But that reason has
been abeady disposed oi. Marx, we have seen, tried but utterly
failed to justiiy it. Inbourpower hos not the peculiar quality
which he ascribes to it. It is not the sole source oi value. And,
therefore, it is not to be inferred that value cen be derived lrcm
no other source. · ,

Iabcunpcwer, Marx further escures usis not only the sole
source ol value but has itseli a velue-‘⁴ the valne oi the sociel
normal labour-time incorporated in it, or necessary to ite repro
ducticn; in this case, the velue of the means oi subsistente
necessary to the maintenance oi the labourer.'' But here again
he mames that he hes proved what he has not proved, and what
iseven, as we have seen, certainly false. He imagines that he
has shown that the duration oi labouris the measure oi its valne;
and that he has consequentlya standard by which he can tell
definitely how much oi it is paid for, and how much oi its velue
isappropriated by the capitalist. But the duration of lnbour is
no such measure, and Marx has not a standard of the kind which
he supposes. All his assertione as to the extera of the exploita-
tion ci labour are, therefore, oi necessity arbitrary.

Marx supposes that labour-pcwer can restore itself, or provide

itself with the physically indispensable means ol subsistence, by
the labour oi six hours, and thet the value oi these means exectly
represents the velue oi that labour. There is no reason lor either

supposition. There is no definite period discoverable in which
,labcur will produce the velue oi the means necessary tc its reprc-
duction; and there is no ground for regarding the velue of these
means as the natural or appropriate remuneration of the labour-
power exerted during that period. rho physically indispensablo
