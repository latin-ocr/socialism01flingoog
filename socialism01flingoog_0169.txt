166 SOCIALISM

contemporary capitalists are not the descendants
of feudal lords or of the appropriators of the wealth
os the Roman Catholic Ohurch, but aro the sons,
grandsons, or great-grandsons of poor men. Probably
a larger proportion of tho wealth of Britain than
that of any other country may be traoed to the

has had its source within the capitalist system itself,
andis not directly at least inherited plunder. Still

Australian wealth.

But here Marx meets us with the cardinal article
of his economic oreed—the continuone capitalistic

of what is due to labour. The capitalist and the
labourer make a bargain, the latter consenting to
accept as weges, instead of the full velue of what
he produces, only, perhaps, a half or a third, or a
quarter of it, and in fact, only the equivalont of
what will keep him and his family alive, while the
former pockets the remainder, lives in luxury, and
continuously accumulatas capital. “ Capitel, there-

form (profit, interest, or rent) it may subsequently
crystallise into, is in substance the materialisation
of unpaid labour. The secret of the sels-expansion
os capital resolves itself into having the disposal
