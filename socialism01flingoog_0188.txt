SOCIALISM AND CAPITAL 185

lent for its deterioration while employed by its borrower, he
would become a capitalist and an exploiter. Sueba conception of
capital is its own refutation. It obviously implies the assumption
that capital is esseutinlly sterile, and unentitled to any profit.
This assumption also needs no special refutation. Oapital by
itself is indeed unproductiv'e. But so is labour by itself. If
capital can produce nothing without natural agents and labour,
labour can produce nothing without natural agents, and extremely
little without capital.

By representing capital ns “an historic category ” Marx meant
that it had not existed in all stages of society, and was even a
comparatively late phenomenon in history. But this view was
only a consequence of the conception which he had formed of the
nature of capital, not a result of historic investigation. Capitol
must be admitted, indeed, to have had an origin in history, to
have been derived from labour and natural egents, and not to be,
as lsbour and natural agents are, primordial in productiou; it is
only a secondmy, not a primary, factor of production. But if it
be conceived of in its proper acceptation as wenlth devoted to
production it must have been almost coeval with man. History
does not inform us ot any age in which capital thus understood
was non-existent. “Mam'’ it bas been said, “is s tool-using

equally with the most complex machine, and as such is equally
capital. Man as a rational being is naturally endowed with the
power of seeing that be can often better attain his ends indirectly
by the use of means with which he can provide himself than by
the immediate and direct action of his own members. This
power, a universal and distinctiva characteristic of bumenity, is
the root aliive of invention and oi capital, two of the chief
secondmy factore of production. Some outgrowths of it are
to be found among the most uncultured peoples of the earth;
and the latest, most elaborate, and most subtle of the mechanical,
commercial, end capitalistic contrivanoes and processus adopted in*
the most advsnoed of modern natione cre only its most evolved

That capital, in the Marxisn sense,is “ an historic category”
may be doubted. No one, it is true, will refuse to admit that
capital may grow, and often has grown, by exploitation, by
