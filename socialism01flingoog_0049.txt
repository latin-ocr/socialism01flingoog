industrial economy so elaborate that a slight cause
may easily produce great disaster and wide dis-
content. The pressure of competition is often very
hard, and many human beings have to labour to an
excess which may well explain the revolt of their

suffer. The foundations of religious faith have been
so sapped and shaken by various forces, that there
are thousands on thousands in the land devoid of
the strength and steadfastness to be derived from
trust in God and the hope of a world to come. In
consequence of the wide prevalence of practical
materialism, many have no clear recognition of
moral law, of right as right, of the majesty of simple
duty. The balance of political power is now un-
questionably on the sido of the majority; and
although it is just that it should be so, it does not
