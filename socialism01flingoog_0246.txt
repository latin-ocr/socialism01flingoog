THE COLLECTIVISATION OF CAPITAL 243

There is another question, and a very important
one, to be answcred. Is it probable that in a
collectivist community there would be much to
enjoy, to consume? Collectivists, of course, assure
us that there would be abundance. But socialist
revolutionists are a remarkably sanguine class of
