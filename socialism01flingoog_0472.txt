SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 471

having “the same mind which was in Christ.'’ It
exists to manifest tho spirit, to apply the wisdom,
and to continue the work of Christ, in order* that
the name of the Father may be universally hallowed,
His kingdom fully established, and His will perfeotly
done even here on earth; and this it can only'do
through sslf-denial, sels-sacrifice, and continually
doing good, or, in a word, only in so far as it lives
and works as Christ did.

The Ohurch is not identical or coextensive with
the kingdom ol' God. It lies within the sphera of
the kingdom which it has been specially instituted
to establish and extend. The sphera of this kingdom
naturally embraces all human thought and life, every
form of human existence and every kind of human
activity, and not merely what is distinctly religious or
ecclesiastical. It is rightsully inclusive of philosophy,
science, art, literature, politics, industry‚ commerce,
and all social intercourse. The kingdom of God can
only have fully come when entire humanity is filled
with the spirit, and obedient to the law, of Christ.
And the Ohurch, the whole body ofbelievers, the vast
host of Christian men and women in the world, has
assigned to it the task of humbly and faithfully
labouring to bring about the full coming of the
kingdom of God.

The relation of the Ohurch, in this its primary
and chief acceptation‚ to what are called social
questions is very obvious ; but it is not ou that account
to be inattontively regarded. It is just the Church
in this sense of tho term which it is of supreme im-
portanoe should be got to interest herself adequately
