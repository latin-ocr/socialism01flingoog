NATIONALISATION OF THE LAND ²19

and unfairprooedure. These who have recommended
it in regard to the rents of land have been in·
fluenced by a false theory, and have neither looked
calmly nor comprehensively at the subject. They
have seen only one side of the shield. They have
gazed so eagerly at the ooveted increments as
wholly to overlook the decrements, though equally
naal. Now, suppose that the British Government‚
about the year 1870, in the belief that landowners
only benefit by their connection with society, had
agreed to appropriate their unearned increments,
but on condition of making up for their decrementa
not due to their own mismanagement, should there
be any: would not the bargain have been a
wretched one for the British people during the
fifteen years which followed? Why, they would
have had decrements everywhere, year alter year,
and increments nowhere. In some of these years,
instead of being entitled to get anything 'from great
landowners, like, for instance, the late Duke of
Bedford, they would have had to give them fifty per
cent.

Instead of being either foolish or unjust, it is
really both the wisest and the justest policy which
the State can pursue, not to attempt the impossible
task of separating the social or unearned from the
individual or earned portions in the incomes of any
class of its citizens, but to leave them both to enjoy
the gains and bear the losses which their connection
with the natica involves*
