they have admitted, be content merely to yield a
few certain specific conclusions capable, in con·
junction with those drawn from other sciences, of
being applied with good effect to answer great and
complex questions which can never be resolved by
any single science or even perhaps in any purely
scientific manner. '

The main argument on which Socialists rely in
support of the allegation that Economics as oom-
monly taught is in its general tendency unfavour-v
able to morality, is that it assumes human nature to
be essentially selfish, fundamentally egoistic; and
that it builds itself entirely up on this assumption.
They say that it lays down as premissas what are
only forms or applicatione of its primary assumption
of the selfishness of human nature, and that from
these premissas-the principles of least sacrifice, of
unlimited competition‚ and the like-it deduces its
¹ chief doctrines. Hence they condemn it, and Ι
demand a new Economic hesed either entirely or s
largely on sympathy aud benevolence; on what
they call “ altruism.”

In arguing thus thorough-going Socialists, such
aethe Social Democrats, have not stood alone, but
have been encouraged and supported by so-called
Academic and Christian Socialists of all shades and
varieties. ΜΓ. Thomas Davidson‚ favourably known
by his contributions to philosophy and especially to
the knowledge of the philosophy· of Rcsmini, has
presented the argument as skilfully‚ perhaps, as
any other writer ; and, therefore,I shall quote his
statement of it, indicating where I have omitted
