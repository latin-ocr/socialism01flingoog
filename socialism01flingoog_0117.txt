and, in particular, the conclusion that all wealth
ought to belong to the labourers is plainly unjust.

‚ I must add, that even if labour were the source of

Nay more, were the Oollectivism of Karl Marx
established, it could by no possibility confer on

their due, the whole produce of their labours; but
only such part of it as remains after deduction of an
equivalent to rents, whatever it might be called, of
the wealth necessary to maintain the collective

the mistake of supposing that the labour directly
and immediately spent on a thing is the only lahour
involved in that thing. The shoemaker when he
has finished a pair of shoes may thoughtlessly
