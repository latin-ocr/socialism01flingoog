SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 431

into a religion that it would be adequate to the
task of organising and regulating all the activi·
ties and institutione os humanity. In Germany
Fr. Feuerbach,* J osiah Dietzgen,† Dr. Stemmss
Julius Sterni and others, have presented sub-
stantially the same view
In England it has found an advocate in Mr. Bar.
The following words of his are as explicit as could
be desired: “ In what sense Socialism is not
religious will be now clear. It utterly despises tho
‘other world' with all its stage properties—that
is, the present objects of religion. In what sense
it is not irreligious will be also, I think, tolerably
clear. lt brings back religion from heaven to
earth, which, as we have sought to show, was its
original sphere. It looks beyond the present
moment or the present individual life, indeed,
¹ though not to another world, but to another and
a higher social life in this world. It is in the hope
and the struggle for this higher social lise, ever·
widening, ever-intensifying, whose ultimate possi-
bilities are beyond the power of languege to express
or of thought to conceive, that the Socialist finds
his ideal, his religion. He sees in the reconstruction
of society in the interest os all, in the rehabilitation,
in a higher form and without its limitatione, of the
old communal life—the proximate end os all present
