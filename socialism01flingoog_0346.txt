SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 345

Besides, Socialism has itself moral presuppositions
and tendencies which obviously demand considera-
tion and discussion: moral presuppositions and ten·
dencies which its adherente must defend, and which
those who reject it are certain to regard with
disfavour.

Accordingly in the present chapter we shall treat
of the bearing of Socialism on Morality.

Socialists charge Political Economists with having
taught as science a system of doctrine which is non-
moral or even immoral. They denounce Economics
as it has been presented by its best accredited
teachers as not only a dismal and unfruitful science,
but one which has been falsified and vitiated by
being severed from, and opposed tc, Ethics They
profess to be alone in possession of an ethical Econo-

mles—an economic theory capable of satisfying'the ¹

heart and conscience as well as reason and self-
interest. But both the censure and the claim are
based on very weak grounds.

One of these grounds is that Economics takes a
narroW‚ unnatural, and unethical view of what ought
to be its own object and scope. It is said that it
confines itself to the study of wealth; subordinates
man to wealth; assumes that wealth includes the

'arefaction of all human desires‚ even while confining
itself to those material things and corporeal services
⁴which minister chiefly to the appetencies and vanities
of the lower nature; practically raises wealth, so
understood, to the rank of an end in itself ; and by

exclusively dwelling on it encourages the delusion
that it is the chief end of life.
