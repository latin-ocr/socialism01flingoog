The man who fancies that the Ohurch ought to
have nothing todo with politics, cannot' have thought
much on the subject. The Ohurch 1100 10 (10 with

the Bible‚ and the Bible is a very political book. ’

The history recorded in Samuel, Kings, and
Chronicles may be called “sacred history,'' but it is
in the 01010 as much politica] history as that nar-
rated by Herodotus, Tacitus, 01 Fronde. The
propheta preachcd politics so very largely that no
man can expound what they uttered and apply it
without preaohing politics 0100. To lecture through
the Epistle of James without trenching on the
sphere of politica one would require to bs not merely
adroit but dishonest. It is true that Christ’s king-
dom “is not of this world‚'’ but also true that
Christ is “ prince of the kings of the earth,'’ and
consequently that all political rulers and politica]
assemblias are as much bound to obey His will 00
00010010011001 leaders and ecclesiastica] 00000110.
Political morality is conformity in certain relations
to the divine law which the Ohurch has been
instituted to make known and to get honoured in
all relations. The Ohuroh 1100, therefore, very much
10 (10 with politica. She has to do with it in so far
00 politics may be moral 01 1111010101, Christian or
anti-Christian; in so far as there is national duty or
110110001 010, 00110001 piety or national impiety.

The (lhurch, however, has 001 10 (10 with politics
in 1110001110 way 10 which the State has. It is not
her province to dealwith politioal measures in them·
