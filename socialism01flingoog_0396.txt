SOCIALISM AND MORALITY 395

ae eumities of class which it evokes may easily
rd to greater horrors than those of nations. Itis
are credulity to suppose that Socialism is tend·

gto the abolition of war. Wherever there is
evalent a militant and revolutionary Socialism
vil war must be imminent and large armies prime
acessities. Were Socialism out of the way we
right reasonably hope that the calamity of a great ,
ὲιπορθαῃ war would not be wholly without com-
ensati0n‚ inasmuch as it might issue in a general
isarmament. But so long as in every country of
lurope there existe a Socialism ready in the train
·f such a war to imitate the deeds of the Parisian
Jommune we cannot reasonably cherish any hope of
she kind. At present our civilisation‚ it has been
rptly said, “ has an underside to it of terrible
nenace; as, in ancient Athens, the Cave of the
Furios was underneath the roob, on whose top sat
the Oourt of the Areopagus. The Socialism of our
day is a real Cave of the Furiae. And the Furios
are not asleep in their Cave.'’* The socialistio spirit
must be expelled before there can be social peace.

F urther, while Socialism has so far favoured
internetionalism it haS, as a general rulo, discoun·
tenanced patriotism‚ Of course, no one denies that

there has often been much that was spurious and
foolish‚ blind and evil, in patriotism‚ or at least in

what professed to be patriotism; much, in a word,
deserving of censure and contempt. F οι· discoun·
tenancing anything of that nature no blame attaches
