There is a quarterly periodical, daed-Time, which is mildly and
waguely socialistic. It is the orgen oi the New Fellowship, a
society which has arisen irom the pomonal and litorary influence
ol Mr. Edward Carpenter, author oi “Towards Democracy,’'
“ England's Ideal,'’ dc. The general aim oi the Now Fellowship
isone with which lew men will fail ιο sympathise ; it is truly to
soeialise the world by truly humanising it. Its central thought
can hardly ba better expressod than in the following sentence of
Mn. Maurice Adams: “The greatest aid we can render towards
the abolition of despotism, and the establishment oi a true
democracy, both in the home andin the State, is to allow the New
Spirit oi Solidarity and Fellowship to have lull possession of our
being, so that it may, as Walter Besant has eo happily expressed
it, ‘destroy raspert and build up remotos,·' ιο allow free play ιο
our sympathy with every human being, that the thought ol hia
subjection or degradation may be es intolerable ιο us aa that of
our own3 ιο give our lull allegiance to the great trnth that only
in mutual service ⁴and oommdeship can we ever realise life's
deepest joy.'’ The membars oi the Now Fellowship are obviously
good, cultured, high-minded men and women, deeply imbued with
the sentiments and ideas which are the inspiration and easence oi
the writings of Ruskin, Thorean, and Toletoi, of Wordsworth,
Browning, and Tennyson. Serri-Time, like Brothrrbood has
advocated the formation ol iudustrial willages ior the able-bodied
poor.

The Sociol Onalook is an occasiond magazina, edited by the Rev.
Herbert V. Mille, Honorary Secreta-ry oi the Home Oolonisation
Society. The attempt made at Sturnthwaite, under the direction
ol Mr. Mills, ended in May last in forced evictions.

The sodalistic periodicals mentioned above are all those known
to ms, but there may quite possibly be others. There are cer·
tainly not a few newspapers and journale which show n bias
towards Socialism.

The Fabian society, founded in 1883, does not maintain an

official journal, but it ia active in isauing tracte. Its lcadin
membere, although nebulone thinkers, ara fluent speakers οοὲῤ
expert writers, and well known as popular lecturam an
essayiste.

The strength ol Socialism in Britain lies mainly in London.
