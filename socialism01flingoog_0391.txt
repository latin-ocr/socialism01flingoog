390 SOCIALISM

the need for charity as it is that it would weaken
the motivas to it and deprive it of resources.
Without freedom and the consequent inequality of
fortunas there might well have been far more misery
in the world than there has been, while there could
not have been the wonderful development of charity
and of charitabla institutione which is so conspicuous
in tha history of Christendom.

Socialists would abolish charity by providing work
for, and rendering it compulsory on, all who are
capable of working, and by granting to those who
are incapable the supply of their wants in the name,
not of charity, but of justice. Are they sure, how-
ever, that they could always provide work for all
who need itt Are they sure that they could always
provide it on such terma as would be tolerabla to
workmenl If they are, one would like very much
to know their secret. If they have one, they have
not yet divulged it. Aa for the idle and dissolute,
those whose poverty is voluntary and disgraceful,
how are Socialists to compel thern to maintain them-
selves by labour except by violence or starvation?
But we could do it by these means without Socialism ;
we are only prevented from doing it by our respect
for human liberty and our solt-heartadness.

Then, although calling what is really of the nature
of charity “justice ’' is very characteristic of Social-
ism‚ it is also a worse than useless device. It can
only do harm to confound the provinces of justice
and of charity. We ought to give to justice all that
belongs to it, and seek in addition to diffuse and

deepen the feeling of the obligatoriness of charity3
