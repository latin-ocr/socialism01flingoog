and implicitly reduces the labour of rare intelligence,
of exquisite artistic taste, and supreme genius to
the level of the mere muscular exertion which may
be replaced with advantage, wherever possible, by
the action of a machine or an animal. In a word,
it is as dishonouring to human labour, as unjust
and discouraging to talant and merit in human
labour, as the doctrine of communiam itself. Yet

ι this doctrine Marx regarded as the very corner-

stone of his Collectivism. On it he rested entirely
his hope of a just payment of labour employed in
production within the collectivist community.
Every suggestion which he has made, or which his
followers have made, as to the administration of
distribution in the collectivist world, is but an
application of it. If it be not true, the “labour
certificates” and “labour chaques,” of which we
have heard so much, can be no better than false
bank-notes. That a system built on such a
corner-stone should have obtained the confidence
of so many persons shows how prevalent credulity
stillis.

So long as Socialists cannot give us better rules
than those just indicated for the remuneration of
labour, or for the distribution of the produce of
industry among those concerned in production, we
must keep to the method to which we are accus-
tomed. It may not always work entirely to our
satisfaction. Still it works with some considerable
measure of justice and success on the whole, is not
incapable of being improved, and does not prevent
cooperation, industrial partnership participation
