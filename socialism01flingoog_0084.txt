COMMUNISM 81
expediency thereos should be perceived by the

nation at large. Governments must beware of
coming rashly into conflict with the reasons and
consciences of even small minorities of honest men.
Otherwise they will have either to make exceptional
laws for these men or to treet them es criminals;
and the adoptiones either alternative must, it is
obvious, very seriously discredit and weaken their
authority. Socialists demand that the State shall
do many things to the doing of which there is this
insuperable objection :-that‚ even were these things
right and reasonable in themselves, there are so
many persons who firmly believe them to be unjust
and tyrannical, that they can only be carried into
effect by a vast and incalculahle amount of persecu-
tion. But persecution does not lose its wickedness
- when it ceases to refer to religion.

Any ve1y simple or rigid solution of the problem
as to the limits of State intervention must, Ι believe,
be an erroneous one. The limits in question are
relative and varying. To traoe them aright through
the changes and complicatione of social and civil life
will require all the science and insight of the genuine
statesman. The truth in regard to thern cannot be
reached by mere abstraction or speculation, and
cannot be expressed in a general proposition.
