THE COLLECTlVlSATION OF CAPITAL 239

thrown out of employment and reduced to pauperiem
and miscry.

But if such be the evil, surely those who would
cure it should make use of measures to lessen
it, and so strive towards ultimately abolishing
it; in other words, one would expect them to
originate, encourage, end aid all schemes and efforts
which tend to make the labourers capitalists ae well
as workmen. Is this what Collectiviets dol Not in
the least; the very opposite. They propose to cure
the evil by universalising it; by depriving every
workman of his tools, by leaving him not a bit of
private property oraehilling of capitaltobe employed
in production, and by giving him, so far as I can per-
oeive‚ no voice in the direction of his labour except a
vote in the choico of his taskmasters. ,

Ina word, this so-called solution of the social
problem is national slavery. The State becomes sole
proprietor, its officials omnipotent, all others abso-
lutely dependent on them, dependent for the very
means of existence, without eny powers of re-
sistance to tyranny, without any individual re-
sourceS, with no right to chooee their work or
to choose how to do it, but commanded end rulod
in a wholly military manner. Werc the end aimed
attho putting of an effective stop to the singing
of “ Britons never shall be slaves,’' Collectivism
would have to be admitted to be admirably con·
trived3 but as a scheme for removing the evils of
which Collectivists juetly enough complain it is
singularly absurd. Its whole tendency isto multiply
and intensiFy these evils.
