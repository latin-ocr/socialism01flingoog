SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY 343

despotism so improbable. It should be observed,
however, that the only way in which we ean con-
ceive of such an event being brought about is one
whieh would be in aooordanee with De Tooqueville's
theory. Let the conflict between labour and capital
in Ameriae proeeed until the labourers attempt to
employ their politioal power in the expropriation of
the capitalists; let the Democraoy of America
become predominantly sociabstio, in the sense of
being bent on attehring the equality which requires
the saorifiee ofjustioe and of liberty ; and there will
hoppen in Ameriae what happened about two thou-
sand years ego, in the greatest republio of the
ancient world, a Oaesar will be called for and a

Caesar will appear, and Democraoy will be controlled
by despotism.” ²*
