24 SOCIALISM

another discussion to be found in the same volume, given a far
more extraordinary definitior: “ Socialism is a word felicitously
devised (beurcnsement tronvd) 2ο designate a whole ol senti-
ments‚ without implying any doctrine,” p. 376.

1 have not been able to find that Karl Marx has given
any iormal definition oi Socialism. Mr. Holyoake states that
he detines the “Socialistio ideal as nothing else than the
material world reflected by the human mind, and translated
into powers ol thought‚” and remarks that “it would require
an insurrection to get the idea into the heads ci any considerable
number ol persons” (⁴‘Subjects ol the Day,'' No. 2, p. 96).
This is a very curicus mistake. The words oi Marx are: “With
me tlte ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by
the human mind and translated into forms ol thought.” See
proi. to and ed. oi “capital'’

Bebel’s definition is very protentione and unreasonable:
⁴⁶ Socialism is science applied with clear consciousness and full
knowledge to every sphere oi human activity’' (⁴‘Die Frau,'’ p.
376, 13th ed, 2892).

Acoording to Adolf Held‚ “We can only call Socialism every
tendency which demands any kind oi subordination of the
individual will 2ο 2122 community'' (“Sozialismus, Sozialdemo
kratie, und Sozialpolitik,” p. 29). Were this so, all but thorough
Anarchists-Anarchists more thorough than any who have yet
appeared-would be Socialists. ’

Dr. Barry, in his admirable ι’1222222222 on Christianity and
Sooialism,” while professedly admitting Held's definitior to be
satisfactory, gives as its equivalent what is really a much better
one: ‘⁴ Socialism must, I take it, properly mean the emphasising
and cultivating to a predominant power all the socialising forces
-all the forces, that is, which represent man’s social nature and
assert the sovereignty oi human society; just as Individualism is
2122 similar emphasis and cultivation ol the energy, the freedom,
the rights ol each man as individual '' (p. 22). What, however,
do these words precisely implyl If a theory oi society do
justice alike to the claime oi the individual and ol the com·
munity, or il a man sacrifice neither 2122 individualising ener-
gies oi his nature 2ο its sccialising forces, nor the latter to the
former, but duly cultivate both, there is no more reason, oven
