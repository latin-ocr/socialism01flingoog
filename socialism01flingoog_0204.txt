SOCIALISM AND CAPITAL 201

mass of consolidated surplus population,’' oi which Marx speaks,
does not exist. His hypothesis of en industrisl rescrve army
produced by ospitalism for its own advantage, end constently
drugging the lsbouring cluss into deepor ond more hopeless
misery, is fortunately only o distempered drcom.

5. The famous Condoroet, in the most celebrated oi his works,
the “Teblscu historique des progrhs dc l’Esprit Humcin,'' pub
lished in 1795, argued thet the course of history undere rigime
of liberty would be towards equelity 01 wealth, as well ss towards
equality iu all other odvcntogos, inssmuch es it would gradually
sweep ewoy ull those distinctions between men according to their
wcslth which hove been originated by the civil lcws ond peu
petoetod by factitious monus, end would leave only such as were
rooted in nature. Seventy-four years letor we find Marx strenu-
ously contending thet when property, trodo, ond industry were
left unfcttersd when lsbour wos unprotectcd, wealth teudcd

the other oi rneny millions of dependent sud pauperisod prole

democretic thing ; surely und steodily pulling the higher classes
oi society down to n lower lovel; surely und stendily ruising the
lower olesees3 destroying ell tired cluss distinctions, moneyedi
inclusive; sud not only greatly incressing the number 01 inter-
