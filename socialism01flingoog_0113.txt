it was necessary to him. It was indispensable to his
convincing labourers that they were robbed that he
should feel able to assure them that they produced
all velue, and that consequently they were entitled
to possess collectively all wealth. People are very
apt to believe what they wish to believe. Marx
was no exception to the rule.

But, further, two celebrated economists, the two
¹sor whom Marx had most respect, Adam Smith
and David Ricardo, had in some measure fallen
into the same error. Ricardo, for instance, had
gone so far asto write thus: “Gold and silver,
like all other commodities, are valuable only in pro-
portion to the quantity of labour necessary to
produce them, and bring them to market. Gold is
about fifteen times dearer than silver, not because
there is a greater demand for it, nor because the
supply of silver is fifteen times greater than that os
gold, but solely because fifteen times the quantity
of labour is necessary to procuro a given quantity of
it.’' ²* Surely these worda, however, should have
been of themselves enough to open the eyes of an
attentive reader to the erroneousness of the hypo·
thesis which they imply. What possible justifica·
tion can there be for a statement so extravagant
as that it takes fifteen times more labour to
procura a given quantity of gold than the same
quantity of silver, It does not take even double
the quantity. It does not, require moro labour to
extractor gather gold, than to werkin a coal or tin
