24² SOCIALISM

also contrary to the welfare of the community. The
Collectivist State would not be likely either to im-
port books adverse to Collectivism, or to treet the
production of them by its own subjecte as labour
worthy 01 10110001011011. So 01 011 things else. If
production were entirely in the hands 01 the State,
the liberty of individuale aa to consumption could
not fail to be unjustly and injuriously limited in
every direction. Where supply rules demand, not
demand supply, desires must be suppressed 01 un·
satisfied, freedom unknown, and progress impossible.

Τ11οΟο]100111101,11110)1 addis bound to justify
his procedure in allowing 0 right 01 property in the
objeots of consumption and denying it in the instru-
mente of production. It 10 1101 enough merely to
draw the distinction; it is necessary 0100 10 show
that the distinction rests 011 0 valid 1110101 principle.
This has not been shown; and, I believe, cannot be
shown. Το affirm that a carriage may legitimately
be private property but that a plough 00111101; that
101011 individual to possess the former 10 right, and
what the State cannot hinder without tyranny,
while to possess the latter 10 wrong, and what the
State must on no account permit, seems at least to
be a paradox devoid both 01 reason and justice. Why
do Collectivists not endeavour 10 vindicate it, yet
expect us to believe itl They grant a right 01 pro·
perty 10 consume, and 01011 to waste, but not 10
produce; not 10 employ with a view 10 0 10111111.
Why is the right 01 property thus restricted and
mutilatedl Would it not be more consistent to

deny and abolish it altogether?
