230 SOCIALISM

to act in relation to foreign trade? It is a difficult
question for the Socialist. If the State engage in
and encourage foreign trade it will fail to get free
of the competition which Socialists denounce, and
must conform its agricultural policy to that of its
competitore. If it set itself against it, it will be
unable to seed a large population, and must be
content to rule a poor and feeble nation. The land
of Great Britain cannot yield food to half the people
of Great Britain. In order that Britain may retain
her place among the nations, it is absolutely neces·
sary that her vast urban and manufacturing popula·
tion should have cheap food, and therefore that the
cultivators of the land should not receive high prices
for its produce.

The nationalisation of the land, then, is not de· ⁴

manded hy justice, and would not be a solution of
the social problem. Its nationalisation on socialistic
principles would be contrary to justice, and incom-
patible with socia] prosperity.
