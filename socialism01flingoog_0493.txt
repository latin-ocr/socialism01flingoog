good 01 mankind, to the advantage of a party, or the
triumph of a sect, or the mean ends of individuale or
classes. Only then will she fully exart the immense
power with which she has been antrusted for the
healing 01 the natione, for the regeneration and re·
novation of society. And then, t00, the world will

can bring to bear upon the hostile parties in a com-
munity a moderating, elavating, and harmonising
influenoe peculiar to herself ; that she can touch
deeper springs 01 feeling and of conviction than any
merely secular power can reach, and thereby do
more to purify publio life ; aud, in 0 word, that her

’ mission is so wonderfully adapted to meet human
wauts that it must indeed be divine.
