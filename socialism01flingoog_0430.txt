SOCIALISM AND RELIGION 429

Religion, as they conceive of it, is necessary to
the completeness and efficiency of their Socialism.
The non-religione among them, with rare exceptione,
look on Religion as naturally antagonistic to the
growth and triumph of all genuine Socialism.

It would have been strange if it had been other·
wise. Socialism is not pure science, not mere
theory ; it is a doctrine or scheme of social organisa-
tion. Can any such doctrine or scheme ignore
or exclude consideration of Religion, and yet not
be seriously defective? Surely not. Social organi·
sation is not merely economic organisation; it
implies the harmonising of all the factore, insti-
tutione, and interests of society, political, morel,
and religione, as well as economic. Economic
organisation, indeed, can no more be successfully
affected if dissevered from religion than if dissociated
from morality or political action. The life of a
society, like the life of an individual,is a whole,
and all the clemente, organa, and functione which
such life implies are so intimately interconnected
that each one influences and is influenced by all
the others. They cannot he separated without
injury or destruction to themselves and the entire
organism. Dissection is only practicableonthe dead.
All attempta at mere economic organisation must
necessarily be unsucoessful3 aud so sar from its
being irrelevant in discussing Socialism to refer to
Religion any examination of Socialism which does
not extend to its religione hearings must be in·
complete. The experience of centurias should indeed
warn us to be on our guard against recklessly
